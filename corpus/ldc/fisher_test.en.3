Hello
Hi
Hi, good night, who is it?
Hi, I'm Guillermo, How are you?
Hi Guillermo
Yes
Oh, I am José.
Hi, where are you from?
Oh, but I live here in Philadelphia
in Philadelphia
yes, yes, how about you?
I'm Peruvian. I'm studying at the Pennsylvania University
Oh, what are you studying?
Eh, I study History
Oh, I'm studyin here as well, I'm senior
At what University?
Pennsylvania University as well
Oh, really?
Yes. I'll finish soon
Oh, great.
but but what
and you, what are you stuyding?
well, I'm in Wharton
hm
so, business yea, but so you're studying for PHD, that's masters exactly.
its, um no, undergraduate.
oh, its undergraduate. oh okay okay
hm mm hm mm, hm mm
oh but are you here now?
sorry?
You live in Peru right?
i, sorry what so you mean?
Do you live in peru?
I mean i lived in peru, three months ago.
ah
yeah, um
so you're a freshman or
no, its just that i studied two years in the university of peru, and then i got transferred here, so I'm an international transfer.
oh okay, so you're not an exchange student, you're transfer?
yeah, I'm going to graduate with the title of this university.
Ah, how nice
Unlike a student exchange, for example no
Yeah how nice, and what do you think until now ?
Eh, the truth is, a bit difficult
yes, but it's the English, or the
Tight, in English, English, in fact is one of, let's say
all, all the work
it's a difficulty, like, eh, i did, studied in English most of my life but anyway, i find it difficult talk in English, compared to Castillan-Spanish
yes yes
No, like, that is, clearly for me
yes
Eh, but aside, yes, by the amount of work that i'm, they send, is also a
More than Peru ?
I yes, i think that yes, they send you more
Mm
more, more than in Peru. Including the last cycle, i in, in Peru with, at my university i took six courses. Eh, in a semester
Hmmm
And, including that way, i think i had a lot less work compared to what i have now, with five course
Mm
It's okay, what happens that I'm taking five courses, and work too
Ah, OK OK
I don't know, suddenly this is equivalent to carrying six classes, something like that.
yes yes
Suddenly it is a, a little less, I don't think that it is so so, so demanding as carrying six courses, but
yes, but I mean it is still rather intensi-
I believe so, yes, I don't know, suddenly in the future decide d-
yes it is hard
of- I, I, I will decide to carry fewer courses, I don't know.  You about how many courses do you take per cycle?
Um it depends.  And and, in general, five but ah sometimes I say, ah no, it is just it is like, but in the end, last cycle I only took four, but now I am taking five
OK, and, and, you
And, but in general, in, in college people only take four.
OK
It seems to me, yes, but at Wharton generally people take five.
I understand.  And besides you work, or
Eh
do you dedicate yourself full time to, to your studies?
Yeah I have yes, I have a little job there at the library, it is work study but it is eh, there, really it is not a job because when I am there,
I study, then it is not like that
Ah, it seems very advantageous.  What, in what, to what, what do you do in, I also work in the, in in the library but but I am a shelver
Mm
Then, really it does not give me the chance to study.
Ah, sometimes I used to do that but no but, in, in which are you, in what part of the library? In
On the fifth floor of Van Pelt
Mm, OK, OK
You, where do you work?
In Lippincott
Where is that?
It is, it is Wharton's library
OK
yes, it is on the second floor.  Mm, no, but, yes, it is there, it is a good job because I only work, and I don't work so much I work five hours a week, sometimes I work ten hours a week but
it continues being like that, I do my homework, actually, then it is not so well, there are, there are times, towards the end, there is a bit more of work because
there are more people who need help and everyone
Hm mm
is doing their research and but in general, it is very no, I don't have too much work.
Hm mm
but yes here it is eh- but what I have seen is that for example, I sometimes from ah, in Latin America, but you see that in Europe,
at the university, they give you during eh, well in general, there is not that much work only in the end, right, then teachers
Ah, in in in England, for example?
eh, yes, in Europe in general, right
yes, I have also heard that, I mean, the amount of for example, of, the, the, the number of hours that they ave per class a week,
Hm mm
they are I think less than three.
Hm mm
So one has a lot of free time. I mean he doesn't have many classes.
yes yes yes
An apart from that I think that that yes, I mean they don't give you too much work, no, I'm not sure, no no no
yes, well, well, well, they, well, don't, don't give too much work but eh, in general they want that you, well you're supposed to right that, that you are
like that, that you read everything, that you do the exercises, and keep on doing all that, right
Sure Hm mm, hm mm
Understanding everything, right. And then at then end, they give you a test and that's your grade. But here in the United States it's
different, right. Because here, specially in history, you have to re- research, and then an essay, then another thing, and another, and a test, and
Hm mm
it's it's better in the sense that you, OK, there are less risks, but there
yes, of course, that, that, that, that, that, definitively that's an advantage, no, right, that there are fewer risks.
the wor- yes, yes, but
Because, really image that for example, you wen to to, to, to, to to determine your grade on a class in one test. Maybe the night before you couldn't sleep well, or
anything could have happened, and suddenly
yes
you don't do so well in the test, I mean maybe you would have prepared a lot, but for X reason you didn't do well on the test, then
yes
i mean, lets say the grade is going to
yes
the grade is going to be lower, i mean, i don't know
yes, yes, yes, but the task they gave me, i mean, one week you have one thing then another
other task, then another task
yes,yes,yes
each system has it own advantages, but in Peru, how is in general?
let´s see, i can tell you, they gave us that task, must be as a midterms
Hm mm
I think everything is about lecture controls
hm mm
let's say along the semester
hm mm
and for a few courses, no all, they ask you at the end of the course an essay, investigation task
hm mm
And also the final exam. But you don't have to work as hard as here
hm mm
i mean, you don't have to write that much
hm mm mm
Here they keep you writing all the time, papers and reviews, isn't?
yes
Not so much over there, I mean, over there rather you had to write it, for example, you wrote it or in the exam, or, or to turn it in, I mean, the research
Hm mm
at the end of the semester. But other than that, no no you didn't have to produce much.
yes yes
And well, I mean, that could be seen as advantageous in the sense that you don't have, they don't, no, they don't ask so much of you, right, I mean
you can live a bit more relaxed,
yes yes
but this point, the disadvantage is that you don't, you don't practice your, your your, your no, you're not in constant practice of of the work
of research, and neither of of how to write, right, I mean sometimes for not writing, so much, you loose practice, right, to write. So
Hm mm, hm mm
that's what I would tell you, I mean, it's more, it's easier, no, I mean
yes Hm mm, hm mm
It's easier, but I don't know if it's, let's say, if they form you as well as they form you here.
yes yes
But it costs, your form- I mean, the, the cost is that h- here they form you better, it's good, but at least I, for example, this weekend, I'm full of things to do, so
you live a bit more, well, at least, I live a bit more anxiously, let's say, a bit more
yes
stressed
yes yes
But I don't know how Wharton will be, I don't know
yes well, it's, it's different because in Wharton well it also depends, well. Depends, because, for example, I say, the classes that I take in general, don't have
essays like that, nor research, just in general, two, three exams, and, and that's that. But there are classes, for example, that have more like, one has the two exams, but also one has projects.
Aha
These,like case studies
And are they products like individual or in groups?
In groups, in general, these days almost everything is in groups. And of course, if they give you homework, things, little things so that you keep on revising, because if not
because, and, and, and, I like them like that, for example, each week to have a homework, small that you have to turn in, because, in that way,
you hav- they make you study every week, right.
Sure
But, that, that, that, I like, sometimes, they do that, but in general, they are exams, or projects. But in
Hm mm
each class there's always an exam, I don't, I've never had a class with just projects, right, but in general two exams, and maybe one project.
Hm mm, hm mm
In the, then, now in the class of we have of Marketing we have a, a project that is like a eh, I- I don't know how they did it eh, eh and
they created a whole software that it's like a simulation and then you, for example, each order, there are like five orders, or six orders, then
you have a group
Hm mm
and then everyone,each group gets a, a company.
Hm mm
Then, one has several products, this company has several products, then one has to decide bases on, on each product, then, where are we going to, from what type of
ho- ho- how are we going to see this product, let's
Oh, that is interesting
place more yes, yes, it is, it is like that how one, one is in a com- of course that it is not like that like in the real life, but
But, that is, it is similar in something at least
it helps yes, yes, it is not, it is not interesting but then, to __ then it is later when that ends, he has to write several like that, essays, to make an analysis
of what did one do, of the, of the mistakes, of what one did well,
Hm mm
Then, there are many things like that as well.  Then everything, everything depends on on the course, but
Hm mm
ehm, yes, here if, there is and I, barely write anything in general.  Then it seems a little strange to me that I had to write.
I see
But, uhm and what more, and now, and the and the time here it __, most probably you don't like it right
What?
Too mu- there is too much cold here right?
Well, yes yes yes yes On, on Tuesday I think, at night, that it was raining
ys
I froze, yes, that is, I have to go with my jacket, I mean with my I have eh- I, I bought a light jacket that is quite warm
__, yes
And I have for, that is, I always go out with it.  But even like that, even, sometimes, using the jacket, I also get cold no.  But well, inside my dorm it is much more, ehm,
Um
tolerable thing, inside the dorm, yeah, the temperature is, it's, it's enough for me.
But-
not warm.
But in Peru, i was told there are regions were it's really cold.
Well, yeah, if you go to the east range
Uh um.
Also at night, mostly, well, if you go to the range during winter, at winter, uh, the winter nights on the range are very cold, yeah.
Oh, i see.
I would say that, i mean, i remember one time, i must have gone to Peru's Range, and it was like, on vacation with my family, and yeah, every night.
It could be even colder than what i have experienced here so far.
Hello?
Hello, my name is Gloria.
Hello, Gloria. I'm Paulina, where are you calling from?
From New York
New York, I'm in Georgia.
From Long Island.
Ah?
From Long Island
Long Island
Aha.
I'm in Athens, Georgia
Oh, from Georgia, oh, my God
Mhm, How's that
I didn't understand what she said.
How?
It was something about religion. She said we had to talk about
You didn't understand what she said
No.
She was talking about religion, what is our opinion on religion, if it helps unite people or if it divides them, if we should all be of the same religion, or what do I know!
Of, Ah, okay. Am, I'm a Catholic. So, I think, I believe that they divide some and unite some. For example, one of my nephews is gay,
then, they in the catholic religion, don't accept gays.
Aha
because God didn't make them like that. But, yes I remember when my, my nephew was born, from age one, we already knew that he, what he, he was going to be.
People don't believe they are born like that, but he was born like that. And, only, if you have someone in your family, is that you know. So, he
has many problems with the catholic religion because they don't accept him, and he knows they don't accept him. But, he finally found a church, on thirty-second, in New York, that accepts homosexuals.
Yes. Good. I think that, as far as religion, that if people followed their religion, there wouldn't be so many problems like in the case of those when they go to extremes, in no matter which religion.
Mm. Aha
If people followed, for example, those who follow Jesus Christ, if they followed the teachings of Jesus Christ, and if they acted how Jesus Christ acted,
Mm
there wouldn't be so many problems.
Aha
But when they start fighting, that's not what he taught
Mm
Jesus Christ.
Exactly.
where there are problems.
Mm
Same with the Muslims,
Mm
or the Jews, the principles of, of those religions and what they teach,
Mhm.
in itself, is, they are good things. But, when the people become fanatic and don't accept all the other people, one respects the differences.
Aha,Aha.
I think that that is when there is division, problems.
yes, yes, yes. Like, this one, what was I going to say? I, at the lunch hour, I, to the ladies where I work, where I work, , three,
I take, this, a book that is by Joyce Myers, and the, ah, everyday scriptures. And I read it to them, so, they say to me, ah, that is shit, that, I say, but
listen to what she is saying, hear that you treat your neighbor well, like you, you would like to be treated. Ah, no, I have no reason to treat her well.
I don't like her, I say, but the whole world is created in the image of God. Ay, we began to fight. So, I say. Look, I want peace, because what happens is of everything, and I, why don't we
talk about the, the, the theme of the day. But, forget about it, it has become, but they still look for me. So, so I can read, everyday.
How good.
Because, there is one who is like a firecracker, and I was telling her that I don't want to be around her because she takes
all of my energies. And, she is always criticizing the whole world, and I don't want to be in that environment. She says, if I read to you every single day, the other days you are telling them
write five things that you are grateful to God for, eh, am, what you think of yourselves, forget about it. She always, ay, you are always reading something religious, that
I say, that is the only thing that has saved my mind because, if not, if I was to criticize, that the whole world criticizes me, and I know that I am a good person, and God me like I am
if I let people take me, they would have thrown me out of the window by now.
Yes
And that is what happens to her, they criticize, so, to her I say, look, God wants you, and how you are, but you have to, you can't keep criticizing the whole world.
And it is the truth, it is the same whe- the
yes
in a one on one relationship, or like religi- like village, like for example what, what is happening in Israel, between the
Right.
between the Palestinian and the
Yes. Right
and the jewish.
Right.
It's sad, and they're always fighting
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Because there are sacred places for both of them, but they don't respect
Right, right.
other people
It's just, it's like, he, uh, uh, precisely the catholic religion, everyone's going, like m-, my friend went to another church. She says to me
this, that, and this, and that, and i say, you have to find the church where you want, what you believe conforms you.
Or that in- i am not going to tell you to go to the catholic church, if it's not giving you anything because i go to the catholic church.
So, then, she, she found another church, she tells me, maybe you should go with me, i say no, leave me where i am, I'm pleased where i am.
And, you know, i go to the charismatic groups, so, then, n- n- i like to go to other churches, i am not going to tell you that i don't go, but i don't want her to-
i already had gone to that church, many times before. And, it took all day on a sunday, and i don't have all day on Sunday to be there.
Three hours, four hours.
Oh, yes
Right.
¿What religion goes, is your friend?
oh, i thing Christian Science, or something like that
Oh
yes, yes, yes. They are like born again Christians, or similar
OK
Something like that, yes.So, you know, she was catholic. But the husband go to the catholic church. I am the only one who go to the church. My baby doesn't like to go, i am always discussing with him, in order that he goes to the church
And he doesn't think that God is helping him, so, i tell hime every day, all of this God gave it to you, like today we were talking about
Katrina, and he say, God did it, what
Mhm
And i wasn't able to convince him that God did it, that was an act, you know, act of God, as the people say, but
God itself, he won't leave them, even the bible said that is going to happen things like that. So, i was telling him, maybe the bible is going to show you what is it
Mhm, yes
Mhm
It's like that, i find that,in terms of religion, many people just go by tradition and
ok, yes
when you go and search the truth
OK
and you really search, you find a religion that
ok, ok, yeah
you like it, but many people who also go just for tradition, they don't even know about what is their religion
Exactly, they just sit there, and when the priest finished, they go away, running
Yes, or the don't study the writings for themselves, nor anyone.
Yes
Yes.  It helps when one starts to study, to believe that it's one's own religion.
This, yes, yes.  How lately, I am going to a charismatic group.  So, I'm understanding more, even if they say it in Spanish, and I don't understand, I can speak in Spanish, but I can't read or write.
So therefore, they gave me a Spanish bible, and I, forget it, I'm reading it but I don't know.  So I go and explain it to them, I read this, and this, and this
This is what, therefore, they read in English and I see if I can understand.  But, it's very difficult, the bible, it's
The Bible, yes, the Bible is difficult.  The vocabulary it uses, in any case, it doesn't matter what language, I find.
Exactly, exactly.  So, I find it really difficult, so, I, they give me some passages, and so I read them, and then, they tell me, this is this and this and this
You know, and they begin to use it in our lives.  And, I say, oh, ok.  So, I understand.
Mm.  Where are you from?
I'm Puero Rican.
Puero Rican.  But you grew up in the United States?
Yes, yes, yes, yes.  I was born in Puerto Rico but I grew up in New York, in what they call the barrio.  In East, what they call the barrio, in Manhattan.
Ok, I don't know.
Yes.  You know, have you always been from Georgia?
No.  I'm from Chile.
Oh, from Chile, oh, okay.
Yes.  I grew up in Chile, and when I finished the second year of High School, I came to study in the university at
But you live - there
The United States, here.
Oh.
And we've been here in Georgia, my husband and i, for two years, but I've been in the United States for eleven years.
Wow, wow, wow, wow.
I liven in Wyoming for a few months, i lived in, in Utah.
Wow.
For several years. And, a year and a half in, in Maryland.
Right. Right.
In Washington ~DC
Right.
And now we're in Georgia.
Wow, you travel a lot.
Dog, like they say.
Right. That's good, that's good, to move like that. You see, i live...
Yeah, right.
I lived in Manhattan, then i lived in the Bronx, and now i moved to Long Island and we stayed here. However, when we retire, we'll live, i guess
In Florida. Because, my child, my old child and my grandchildren live in Florida.
Oh, so you're going to
So, i would like to go, i would like to go to Florida to be near them. But, by the time i go there, maybe my grandson will be married.
Because he's already seventeen years old, by the time i retire, that's 10 years more, he'll be twenty-seven, maybe he'll get married.
Maybe, somewhere else, yes.
I'm going to be the,
oh yeah we, from here, who knows where we are going, because
yeah
lets see, lets go, my husband finished his PHD
ha
y two more years, and then where there is work,
oh where there is work, and what do you work in?
yeah, I'm at home with my kids,
oh, oh, you're at home with you're kids, that's good.
mhm, i have two babies, one is one year old, the other is three.
oh my god, yeah yeah, its a lot of work, right? i do children parties, i dress up as a clown, and now I'm trying to imagine, how to make elmos head.
because, i have the bodysuit, but
oh yeah
the head is my friends, so, me and her made that party, and then, sometimes they ask for two, and we couldnt go, one can only go.
oh
so I've been trying since then, my friends making it, but its very heavy, so i don't know what to do with the head.
so and apart from that, because, that's why i wasn't hearing what the lady was saying, and i said, I'm doing lots of things, i have to concentrate.
all at the same time, yeah
all at the same time, because they sometimes call, and they don't call, and sometimes i get it, and i dont, and i already had, they had given that discussion last week, i dont know why they discuss over the same thing.
oh really?
You know, have you been doing this for a long time, this?
Ah, I've done, ten, eleven, I think.
Oh, like me, yes. Me too, yes.

But I think that after three years of marriage you can apply for citizenship.
yes, but I have a problem because I already have a double nationality, I have my Venezuelan citizenship and I'm also Italian.
Because my dad is Italian.
Oh. Do you speak Italian?
yes, so.
yeah
I think that if i accept the American citizenship they will make me
quit now
exactly, with the citizenship, and that's not convenient.
Mm, the other two citizenships, i would have to find out tho, because i can be a double citizen in chile, i could have double citizenship.
yeah but the thing is that i have two, they don't let you have three.
you're right.
yeah
its a little hard.

And the aquarium. and I would take my dog to walk outside.

For this in and not feel if we went out for a month recently. Ah, I which is my home now where I'm talking about.
And we had to close the yard and ponder for cartons to have the hill just outside because it is so small the dog is a Labrador.
Exactly.
Then, in and out of the garage door open but it is in a space where you can walk and run and play.
yes, I want If he can come and go, he can play in the yard and stuff. So no.
And it has
Run and beyond, it will work out.

Eh Well, me, to me, I like all types of mu- almost all types of music, eh, except rap and hip hop
eh
Aha,
everything else, uh mm, Latin and American. Eh, I like it all, I like Rock in Spanish, in English, I like, uh, music
classic, opera, dance, everything
and you?
pardon me?
Above all, I like live music, I like it a lot.
how?
Live music.
Live, like in concerts?
Aha.
Eh, eh, not that much, I rather, eh, eh, I, what I do is that I eh, search for music on the Internet.
Okay.
like the, all the music that I have, the ones that I have, I have around five hundred CDs that I've bought and
Aha
many, I've many more that I've searched for them on the Internet.
Exactly.
Ah, the way for me to, for me to, I mean, to me, I mean I need music for everything, I need to listen to music while I work, while I study
eh, I always like to listen to music, it keeps me alert. I guess that, to me, yes, the music, yes, it's pretty important.
and it's substantial eh
Exactly
it helps me concentrate, it helps me to rela-, to relax eh I don't find, for me music can change my mood. yes, it can- I can be
Exac-
very quiet and if I hear a song that can ruin my mood or also I can be in a bad mood and I can hear a song that makes me happy
Exactly, exactly, no yes, I always I because I, no, eh, I play my instrument, and my husbands plays his instrument and at least, ah, maybe some that are festivals and things like that
OK
there is a bar near my house where many people come to play every night nothing people sit there, and play an instrument
and there are open circles every night and there are songs of, where people play and then on weekends different music groups come
to play every night of, in, on weekends an it is really cool.
OK.  Eh, what, what is your favorite type of music?
I like everything.
Do you have some kind of music you don't like?
At least I like eh what don't I like at least yes rap hip hop I don't like or at least music, ah, pop
so if it is Britney Spears and that no, I don't like it, it doesn't get my attention at all.
OK.
I like, ah, I like a lot ah this at least Spanish rock, I have many Spanish rock songs and bluegrass So
OK.  And what, do you have a favorite group?
Well, I like, at least Spanish rock I like Fito Páez a lot
OK.
who is from Argentina
yes.
yes, I do like him very much.
OK
And, ah mm I music like American music there is a man whose name is he is very good
What
and he that they died ah that also he was very, very singing but at least around here, where I live, there are many people who play
oh.
many friends of ours who play and sing and have bands
yes.
and all the groups they have they are, they are very, very good also
OK.  I to, for me I mean, well no, eh mm I maybe you, one or two concerts every year but no no it, because
in general the type of concert to which I go is more eh, it is rock in, in English an in any case that eh, people who go are more like
very young and like it is too scandalous.  In that way that for, for that I don't, it doesn't attract me to go to concerts as such.
Ah
Well and I at least this year I went to a concert of ah, Willy Nelson
Aha
and Bob Dylan
yes.
and there were people of all ages, there were people of even sixty or seventy years and there were children of ten, eight years old at the concert
yes
yes, and well, very fun.  They are in a small stadium in a, in a small baseball stadium and there wasn't, yes there weren't many people but
But it was very good,very good the concert.
What,eh you buy music or do you have many C-Ds
more yes,that everything we buy music but we also buy many music of groups so that,that that they are not very popular, that is people that we know.
yes.
yes,because we are members from one of the ah music society folklorica from Philadelphia and then at least they have many musicians
they are members and have concerts in the houses and all that all months
okay
there is a concert,in in a house of a member and we all bought all those C-Ds
OKAY.
of groups that we see that they are not too super,super famous but they are good
okay
And at times we have seen,for the least groups that we
And
us know that we were famous and all of a sudden the what we are hearing in a festival or something
yes
and all of a sudden we hear a song that is famous
okay
but
it and those eh you said that you play instrummenst,eh es-you your husband play like in a band a group?
No,no,no My husband used to play in a group.because that is that group is not together.maybe they will get together again
OK.
but no, we don't play for any group, or sometimes my husband plays with his friends but what happens is that we don't don't have time, like that for
for, for committing ourselves with people
OK.
because of work and that we we, and, and then we don't have time commit yes, with a group because if you have a group, you have to rehearse at leas a day
Rehearse and look for the
week
the promotions and
Yeah.
yes.
So, yes, you have to give it lots of time, and the, at least the there is a group that wants that my husband plays with them
but where they meet, they meet on Wednesday night at around ten at night and then the rehearse like until two in the morning, on Wednesdays,
since he has to work and, in school and that, he doesn't have any time
yes. Ah, yeah, I, I would I I would have loved to have time to eh eh be able to play an instrument, but I'm terrible with that sort of thing but to me for me the
musi-, music that for me is very, very necessary. For me eh, I a me-, for me, I love, I mean eh, I am, I can be ah
I, I remember songs of, of many songs of
Mm.
songs that I can go through many years without listening to and in a moment the in-, eh listen to, the song again and after many years I can who-, sing the whole song
That happens to me, that I do spend a lot of time without singing a song I forget it. But I, I was, the other time I was talking to a friend and
and we were with her, listening to a song on the radio that I hadn't hear like for eight years and she remembered the whole song
and after they aired a song that I have not listened to and it had been about four years that I had not listed to it and I knew the song and
knew that I knew the song but I did not recall the the lyrics of the song bu-, I remembered but a little, not much.  I do forget it if not, if not
if I don't listen to it the whole time I forget the lyrics because of that, I know the song, but I forget the lyrics a little bit.
Oh, well, I, to me, for me it is that for me depends on, on, on what mood I am, I go, since that about
well I ehm, I have an Ipod Do you know what the Ipods are?
Aha
Ehm, well for me, ehm, I have about ten thousand songs in, in the, in the Ipod
Aha
and well I have well of everything, I have a, ahm, a list of music that only has just music for, of, of, of dan-, of dance dance music
I have a complete list that is, ehm, just about rock in, ehm, in English that that is, basically ehm is the one I use for, when I go to the gym.
Exac-
I have a list that is, ehm, of music just in Spanish a list list that is of music that only like classical music, opera, things like
for relaxation
Oh, and to study
ehm I have a, ehm, a list, ca- ehm On the contrary.  For me ehm, to study I can not have that type of music I can not have classical music, I need music
yes?
That it has lyrics because it if there are not, if it doesn't have lyrics it is like it bores me, I need something to distract me
What, what do you study?
Eh. Eh, with-, I work with virus
OK
in biology
OK
so that, I always need something to distract me, that, that keeps me alert
Exactly.
Yes, yes if I play music like classic no
Mm.
I, I fall asleep, I have, I play classical music when I have many times when I have to eh, if I have to write a, a report that I have to focus a lot, a lot, a lot
well, then but always since I was little, when i had to study, I always played music and while I sang, I could be reading and my dad always, he criticized me that I
it is impossible for a person to be able to read and sing at the same time but I don't know, it always worked for me I always had good grades, so
I guess that
I had a teacher
no
that said that when no, this I was studying something like that that you have, something that you have to learn that if you sing it you have to learn it, you learn it better
fast than if you read it normally
yes, that I don't, it doesn't attract me at all.  Music, I mean, eh you can
hello, hi
hi, you are talking with Fabiola
and they connected you, so it will work
and that's how it works, and they pay you then
oh, look yes also
cool or not, that is the subject i told you to talk, and they give you a topic of conversation
then we must talk about the memories
about the best thing that ever happened in your life
ah
and how has your life changed?
OK
and what is the best thing that ever happened in your life?
ahh a lot of things
but the best thing you feel that has happened in the life
ahh
that is a good subjet
know someone with these children
yes
I think it was to meet someone, because if I had not known
yes i say the same
wouldn't these children be here
OK the best that happen to me it would have been know my husband
yes because how
and the second best thing that happen to me it would be have children
yes
being healthy
yes because i wouldn't have to know the kid i wouldnt be here
and for real
other people wouldn't have these children and i didn't know you neither
yes
if it wasn't for him neither
why? its all right about good themes, so we find good themes for talk when you speak there because they also put you the music that it was yesterday
yes
yes i was entertaiment we talk twelve minutes and they cut you
he they like me
if they tell you that you have thirty seconds to say goodbye
oh
so we have twelve minutes to speak about what we want because they know are voice
but how do you called to this there is nothing about to talk they say
there is something to talk, talk about what they say or what you want the idea is speak because they are recording all the talking
ah so that after the computer knows eh
who is who
and by the, for the accent
by the accent, the system, eh the form of talking and
mm
the ringtones of you and are inventing something
yes so
so people are needed who have different voices
ahh no idea, and I had not called because I said you cannotcall
and the
earlier
yes, all the girls connect through this number
yes
if you talk at the same time, at the same hours
ehh
and and connect then connect well
then I try to call later or in the middle of the day or at best, I don't know
yes but I don't know if you can make two calls at the same time
on the same day
so I don't know if you hear the voice of the beautifulchildren
if you hear that then they are here
it sounds very very clear, yeah
both are laughing
are being, are they doing that to be laughed at?
both are sitting here sitting on my legs facing each other and laughing
look and laugh and say hey you look like my, no no no you'll like my
and the one that has the pacifier tied the bib and then throws the pacifier which stuck to the strip
children are entertaining, ahh they are growing, do you talk to them?
ahh
Have you got them to speak now or not?
What?
if you talk, do you talk to the children?
Yes, yes I talk to them, I speak to them all the time
In English?
In Castilian
ohh
and he speaks to them, in English
in English that is good because they will have two languages
if it is so, so then the languages will grow with God
yes
because yes and also they grow with a, not having an accent
he, imagine me a Geni with two languages also eh talk to me in two languages, ehh he already can read the two languages but all the same has an accent and Spanish is difficult for him
eh
and although since being a little girl and her first three years, was born here
m
but at her two months and a half I took her to Chile and in Chile the same
Where did she learn to speak? Did she learn when she was in Chile?  yes then
she learned some words only, but she could not say complete phrases because he
ahh
we used to come every year for vacations and stay a month here
ah
and the father always spoke to him in English
ah then she was like confused
yes sure, and the eh he and when she listened, listened a bad Spanish from Michel
m
or a bad English from me
ah
now I speak a better English, Michel speaks a better Spanish and she can read both languages and she is better but yes she she get confused when daddy
speaks with accent and a very strong accent
the, the bad thing I am doing, I mean I speak in Castillian but the bad thing is for example when I am with another person and they speak English
I speak tothem in English, understand?
Isn't that bad?
why?not, but it may be bad since my accent is, understand?
is not good, right?
and I know they are little now and they won't, they won't talk now but, oh maybe they are recording it all
yes, from the fourth month kids start to
but
have you planned what you shall do for Christams or Thanksgiving?
For Thanksgiving we will have lunch with my,  with Armi's grandparents of Armi, they come back for lunch because my
yes
my mother in law is fixing the house
yes
so we will have to go where his grandparents and them together

a big remote control car
ahh
it was a hundred and sixty dollars I found it on sale for fifty dollars
what kind of car is it?
it's a James Bone
Ohh
it is James Bone and a remote control I'm going to give it to him as a gift from Santa
eh
and for Jenny I'm still looking for it, there is something that she likes a lot and it is a game boy but a new one
m, oh okay
that you, you don't use little keys, you touch the little things and it starts moving
yes
a new one, a super new one that was just released
oh
so, I think I'm going to use that one for her, because I know that's what she wants
and what did you get her for her birthday?
a karaoke machine
a karaoke machine, do you use it or not?
yes, she sings, well, because of her age, she reads the lyrics in the screen, they light up, they change color
m
so, she sings the song
ahh
she has fun with it, I tell her it's good for her because she will practice her reading, she's preparing herself for Christmas and my father-in-law
I bought her a present on Jonathan's behalf
m
it's a
for the
for the computer, it's used to move the mouse around
eh?
you move the mouse and there's a calculator.
the mouse has a calculator?
no no no, the part where you move the mouse is a little square
oh that, that, that plastic thing
and that
oh OK
so i bought one for my father-in-law and one for us from Jonathan
huh?
huh and you think that, another good idea and i don't know why
and you're going to be here for winter or are you going to?
no we bought the tickets already, we're going to Arkansas we're going to arkansas to spend uh fifteen, a week
a week
yeah, every year we go a week
oh me uh Cristina told you that other time they were thinking about going to to Chile for work
ohh yeah
and that's when it didn't work
no but it hasn't started yet then
but she told me that maybe not and everything that
of course but maybe it isn't true that it isn't and it's not true that it is
hmm
they told him that, they have the personnel in case of anything they'll let him know
yes
is like we'll call you later
something like that
but it turns out that the job in Chile still hasn't started
oh
it still is, I also got emotional I tell Michel, Michel if we get it we leave
you would leave
Michel yes yes but
m
eh the same as I think I tell him but how are we going to go if we just boug the house, how?, you tell me
eh
we sell it well and it makes me laugh because for him it is like so easy like nothing else to get rid of, take things and get rid of them
and for me it is rather difficult
because it took a lot of time to find a home
yes then put it together, I tell you that I still don't put the curtains up those curtains are arriving little by little
eh?
we bought them at JCPenny
m
they are arriving little by little yes the curtains arrived first, last night another part arrived, a bread the top part
eh?
then I received the other top part and I still need they have, I need three mor curtains more that have to arrive and have not arrived
and are they, are those curtains for the living room or?
the living room / dining room because I didn't put them I didn't put eh how do you say it, blinds
ah you didn't install blinds?
no because the rest of the home I installed blinds but to the living room / dining room no because the windows are not windows, they are picture windows
ahh
then they don't don't exist in that size unless you have them made exclusively for that
especially for
Hi
Hi
Who's there?
My name is Anny
Hi Anny I'm Arturo
Hi Arturo
Where are you calling from?
Miami
From Miami, great, I'm talking from
Where?
Philadelphia
Philadelphia
Yes, where are you from?
Uh, Puerto Rican
Oh, OK
And you?
I'm Mexican
Oh
Yeah
Are you studying here at the United States?
yes, exactly
that's good
do you study or work?
no, i have a girl that's 23 months old, and a boy thats 4 days old
oh that's so cute.
so yeah, I'm not working but
yes, that's good, of course
not away from my house
yes, of course, a lot of work at home i imagine.
yes
I'm glad, but you're very happy i imagine, right?
yes, a little bit, I'm tired right now, but im very happy
yes, hes four days old.
four days
wow that's a little bit.
yes
hes young, hey, so, Why are you in the united states? have you lived here your entire lie?
yea, my parents are from the Dominican republic.
okay
and in 1970 something, I'm not sure when it was exactly.
Mmm
Oh, I think it was in the 73, I'm not sure
Mmm
But a revolution in Santo Domningo
Okay
They moved to Puerto Rico
Ah, okay
Then they spent more than 20 years there
I see
Then, from there, my sister, when she started college she moved to Florida, that's when we also moved to Miami
ah Okay
I had 5 years old I think
Oh, a really little girl
Yes my sister is 10, 11 years older
Oh, okay
Then, you know, we stayed and
yes
i attended school here, and well, we made a life here
yes, of course
and
And right now you're married to, is it to a Latino, or to an American?
An American
Ah, okay, I see
yes, I met him at university
ah, okay east of there in, in Miami I'm guessing
No, eh, I went to
Ah, okay
in
Okay
Then I met him there
ah, I see, very well,
Then
And
after, ah
And what, and what language do you speak with, with this, with your, good thing that right now you don't even talk yet, your children the truth because
Good
The other one is twenty-four months old right,
eh, she's twenty-three months and the other one is four days old
twenty-three, yes, it isn't
What we do when he's not, at, my husband is not home
mm
I completely speak Spanish to my daughter
OK
So when he is here, we speak completely in English
ah, OK
And then she can be knowledgeable in both languages
recognize them,
and, I, I am surprised because a lot of times she says things
ah, yes
that I did not, did not even realized she had learned
ah, very true
It can be in English or in Spanish
wow aha,
And so like that she is catching on
Very rapidly
yes,
also I don't know, or rather at what age children start speaking normally, I don't know the truth
And mm I believe that she was, that she had, let's say fifteen, sixteen months
OK
As she's learning English and Spanish
aha
Eh. it takes the kids that do that It takes them a little bit longer to talk
yes, yes,
So my daughter it took her you know, her friends, and whatever her friends
yes,
Eh, they spoke more clearly than her
yes,
ah, until recently
ah,
So now she, I knew that she understood and could talk
yes, but
But since she had both languages it was a little bit harder
Sure yes, it has to be much harder but But, I think, in the long run is going to be very good also, like that they grow up with two languages which is an advantage
yes, yes
is true
So eh, But, you know, she, I knew that she understood
mm
What I was telling her in English and in Spanish
yes, yes, I can imagine
And now, you know, specially I know she understands me because when she doesn't want to do something she like plays dumb And I you know,
yes
I see the little face and I know she understands me exactly
yes, ofcourse, but they are very astute the children then no
yes, yes
Know
yes so, but you know, she understands it, she speaks it
mm
and
Well yes hopefully and she maintains like that, because then when she starts to grow up and and many of her friends speak English well then they will practice english more
yes and no we aren't going to send her to school, I'm going to teach her at home
ah, okay
Because I am, was a teacher
ah,
And so I think that for me to go to work and teach a you know, sons or children of another person because of that I stay at home
aha
And I can teach my own children
yes, that is true
Yes so
but but what do you think of the that they will not have school companions, that that
Good
That is an experience too, no like
yes they have programs here in Miami, for the people that teach their children at home
aha
the eh, normally one time a week, they meet each other
ah, okay
they is like a school, maybe that, that eh, a clas sin a church or a university, whatever, but is like a school that meet every week
ah, okay
the yes, you know that, with their friends and all, i have a lot of friends and families that did that
el
mhm, and they don't have any issues
ah, okay
you know, but, is not something that
yes
because to me, it concerns me too, i want that she can make some friends and all that
yes, right, that is what i was thinking at, because yes, is part of the experience,no, being in a school and know people
yes, yes
the i think, that is important too, is that, it doesn't have to be that way when you are a child, because the truth is you friends are very important
yes, yes
I think, no
yes, yes
but yes as long as i had a contact with other people unless one
and also you know, they have sports of, of the, other places in the community
yes there is many, is because there is a lot of assistance to the community, true and that
yes, you know, things like theu said, they socialize
yes, I see
ahh, you know,
yes, yes,  yes, I like in Mexico that is so commun understand, it doesn't happen anyway
yes
then, I don't know  people lthat had come out from that type of schools, you know, and always I had curiosity like the law here in the United States, because here is commun, there is a different
What is out from the school in your house Oh, so far know I don't know
yes, ah the, that you know, is like any other experiences, like one is taking it, you know, can be good can be bad
yes, yes, yes, yes
But I also think that it is the school
yes it can be bad also
yes that, that alsoI want her to have friends and all dad to her and for her
yes, of course, but it can be careful because invoices are not good safe
yes, yes,
can be bad
yes, no, I but for that reason I want to read becsuse I can teach anything and have to preparef For year
yes,
you know
yes, yes
yes it is a little different that, lets say like is presented in school
yes, that is true. Until what grade do you think about going home schooling in your
uhm, I don't know. I have not thought about it, since he/she is only two years old
yes.
And I have not started yet
With time I will see that
yes, so then
But, how do you think, or rather you, rather you think about all the primary or that
oh, it will probably be until, until, at least sixth grade
okay
So, then, from there, so then lets continue because, I don't know but you know, I, I, with my, I can teach her until High school
oh yes
oh,
Or you have, you have taught classes all the way through high schools or what?
yes, yes
well and what subjects more than anything
Eh, well my, well, I was special education teacher
yeah
So I showed everything
Ah , okay, I see
So, you know, the only thing that, if I don't know something
yes
If i don't understand the subject or whatever, then i teach myself to be able to tech the children
Ok, I see
Then, you know, like things like algebra
Mmm
It's not that i don't know it, but i might have forgot it
yes
Because i don't use it
yes
Then, you know, before giving hte class, i remembered all those things
Mmm
Which was what i was supposed to do
Yes, of course
Then i could teach them
ah, okay
For me it isn't really difficult, i know that it might be for someone else, but it isn't for me
yes, but, I know that in high school they start to specialize more the subjects, and well chemistry and physics are more advanced
And also this time, I know that now
aha
They even have classes that, that the children can take or the students that they can take on the computer
yes,
And they can go to a, a high school let's say on the internet
yes,
So you know, there are many, many, many options.  That it is not only from
yes, yes, yes
You know, one has to
yes, no
that put him on a public school too
hmm
You know, I know that the Universities here
hm
Have ehm, classes for children as well, in high school that they can take in the University
yes, I have heard about that
So you know, we have many options
A lot, very good  Good luck
And that
But yes like you say as well, that is only is two years old no  we don't have to think that much about that Yet.
No, but as my husband says, you know, I'm a teacher
aha
and I'm always reading books, i am, you know eh, singing songs
mhm
to make her, you know, to entertain her, but at the same time, not be eh, Learning something always
yes, OK
so you know, I'm not giving her formal school
OK
but I'm raising her
mhm
little by little, and she knows the alphabet. well, knows the song
yes, now reads
yes, aha, so she knows eh, the numbers
yes
a little, you know, if i tell her, she can tell me "two, tre",  then the next one, she knows that eight comes after seven, you know things like
yes, knows the order
yes, not at all, but, bit by bit
yes, that's good
so you know, so
yes, sounds very interesting
yes
That I do not know anything,don't know how,or if I had a situation I would not know what to do because I could never imagine how
give classes to my son I could not do it,because also,I say the truth I'am not so Eh,No I did not have an education to give classes you understand me
mhm
I imagine that you have studied something like Education something like that no?
well this
O what do you study?
i studied yes education but they didn't exactly teach me how to teach lets say like teach a child how to read
yes,no
All those things I had to learn while I was working
yeah
Then I'am using the experience
sure,sure.sure what aquire in all all schools gave classes
yes but for that reason,is that you know I,for me for i do with me with my children
mhm
it is not a problem because i do not have experience,I don,t know you know how other people do it
my name is mariza
hello, good afternoon, my name is Lorena, I'm here in San Antonio, Texas
hello
hello, eh, so the subject of the present day is the most poignant right
right, it's been hard to me to think which is the best and which is but
exactly, now i said well, it's going to be the memories , i said, memories are as precisely the most important thing that can happen to you in life, because you live of memories, no?
exactly, with so, eh, with so, and i don't know, as much time passes, more memories are, don't know, would not even know which one choose to start
ah
for example, the best
so the best is, well, I'm a mom
yes, me too
and maybe yes, if i would like to think the best thing that happened to me, the best thing is that, having children, I remember the time when I was giving birth and i said: this is the best thing that has happened in my life, so i want
sure
I want to be consistent, i mean, with that comment that I made ​​myself in moment that were happening, but nevertheless, there must be other things
wonderful and you can't choose only one, true
sure because that's what I was thinking and also i was wondering what would have happened, it would be a different life now. in that case of not having children
yes, yes, yes, so
is, is
because
positive and negative emotions, then also not all is beautifull, not precisely, so i have a son that, that have a problem, a health problem, and that's painful
yes
so, well, however, their emotions are kind and loving, and the husband, well, the husband
yes, it's like no, no, yes, yes, but the kids, the kids
that h as a lot to do with it, a lot
yes
in, one's life, no and this
no
but I, one would think that it can't possibly be just one event
sure,
a painful event, I remember a painful event, the death of my mother, for example
sure, the death of a family member, a loved one, it has to be the worse thing to happen to someone
yes, yes, yes or having a sick child, too, that too
yes that too
it's painful, but, as I say, you can't say it's just one, it's nice to try and think of one, no
sure, like the second part of the question, what was it? What would've happened in your life had you not done certain things, that negative or painful event
ah yes
I mean, what would happen if that person was still here, for example, my mom still lives but my grandparents, the two of them have been dead for a long time now
and I never got a chance to say goodbye to them because I was living far away, so if they were still here, life would've been quite different, because they never got a chance to meet my  husband or my daughter
so, yes
exactly, exactly mhm
Of course, life would be very different
hmm your husband, Where did you meet him?
here in the United States almost by chance
aha, because you are Spanish
and I do, I´m Spanish
aha, yes
and I came here to study with the  study but I met him and at last I stayed here and I have twelve years here
aha
and nothing, I have a five years old daughter, is I couldn´t tell him, well my life has changed, of course, because children change our lives, but she is so young that still has much
yes, of course yes, aha
and then well nothing, I don´t know is different when your children are older, if they become more independent, but I have still to go through that
yes yes, and, and there are so many things and so many stages
and of course,
well, but this age when they are younger is the most loving
yes, yes everybody tell me the same
hmm is the most loving and well when they grow up and have their own lives, for example well is nice but you don´t receive anymore the
today as a mom I did very well, is ,I am, and hear mom this is like at a conversation level, like a level
there is not so much dependence, there is not so much closeness like
yes
but it is very nice, the truth is that it is very beautiful and then, which is the best thing that has happened to you, the best memory
well I believe that, the same as you, to have children, well I only have one, and I don't believe that, I don't know if I will have more
yes
it was no, no I mean I don't think I'm ready to be a mother because it was a really big change and the pregnancy was hard and the, ah
he, we have raised her, my husband and me here alone, so it was a little difficult but it was also clear that having a son changes lives, so then it's the best that has ever happened to me
for now
yes
eh, nothing can be compared to that I say
yes it's true, it's what I'm also feeling, I thought about other things that have happened to me and one can have nice memories of achievements in life
of course
like a person, in sports or in academic life or in work, no
of course and, and that is why, the other question would have been different if that hadn't happened maybe if I wasn't a mother my life would be very different
the same I would have ended my studies, I would have
yes exactly
of course, gotten a more important career, or I would have traveled more or met someone else, but of course that can't be known only imagined
exactly, exactly and nevertheless one is accumulating
yes but
memories in pictures of Christmas and the pictures of the school festivals and the pictures of the children's sports festivals
oh
it's like precisely, go building this life because it's made out of memories
exactly yes, all the pictures I have are thousands and thousands, all of them are my daughter's, that is why, he
it is easy to say that it is the most important thing, eh because besides that of course, besides that well I don't know, I have travelled a lot, I have met interesting people but it can not be compared to
to children I guess
mm yes because this is like very, like very complet, like very you don't study to become a mom, you don't study to be
no
be human you don't study to learn to love but in the end like it is the deepest and most complete emotion, no
yes like I tell my sister she doesn't have children, until you become a mother you are not going to know how to be a more let's say
more complete woman because they don't have, they have been married twenty years but no, they don't have children, I don't think they are going to have them, and then well it is difficult to explain
it is difficult to explain
it is very difficult to explain one is not like they say
but, but you say that well that I had it, because I wouldn't have wanted to miss it
yes I had that's why I say I turned thirty, and I say OK I think that it is time now that or now, or, or, or we have one now or later I don't want to have one because
of course to raise a child you have to have a lot of patience a lot of energy and a lot
a lot of energy it is
everything yes, yes, and my daughter who is eh she requires a lot of patience a lot of sacrifice
aha
and
yes, yes really, and she for example, because, because she is very mischievous
she is very active, very hyper-active and eh I don't know she is not a girl like I was when I was little, I was rather quiet, and I did whatever my parents told me, not her, she is more
she is like three, sometimes she is
yes, yes yes
I end up tired, after every day, but well, she's like that, she's like that, you have to accept your children the way they are.
That's right, yes, yes
And
And, uh, and then you really understand why, uh, why they're like that and all that having a strong and very active character will help them accomplish, right?
Yes, that's what i think, or i hope that she
she will accomplish many things, i believe
Yes, yes, with, if i compare her with my nieces, who are very different, i think that my daughter is, i don't know, she has a stronger character, maybe it will help here in the future to do better.
Yeah, with, with all the difficult things that come across her, the challenges
Right
Right?, well i have a daughter, the youngest one, that she's a little bit like that and she, aside from being very good at school, well, she's an excellent sportswoman
Exactly, yes, that's what we want, we also want my daughter to practice some sport, but we want to wait for her to get older, because at five years i don't know, maybe she's too little but
she has the body to, let's say, to be a sportswoman and maybe that will help her develop more and
can make her character too
Yes
like give it direction, right?, um
and, and maybe she'll calm down
And make her tired
Yeah, yeah, i need that, because sometimes we go to sleep before her, we can't take anymore, yeah
Yeah, they need to wear off, oh my god
i don't know, there are some people that tell me it her age
Where do you live?
Right now we live in Philadelphia
Ah in Philadelphia, I have an older daughter studying at the university of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
Oh, what a coincidence, it's a good university
Yes yes yes, so she's in Philadelphia
Yes yes here is a city where a lot of people come to studying, a lot of young people one of the most important, that that is another important thing, the education.
eh and now
yes of course
of course I would like that my daughter also went to university, but I still have many years left for that
yes but of course that is what she is going to do. What did you study?
I Criminal Justice well psychology but I didn't finish the degree
uh huh, uh huh
well after I was pregnant, the girl, we wanted to bring her up at home we didn't want to take her to a day care because we want I don't know it's the more traditional way as they raised me, that they had me with each of my parents, they took care of me,
mhm, mhm
we don't want to leave her alone in a day care so in the
that well it's a good decision
yes yes, it's good eh
I support her have to take many vitamins to have all the necessary energy
yes while one can, now yes, yes, yes and
and now you will see like when I spent more time yes I now my smaller daughter turned fifteen years old yesterday
wow
then now when, when you look back you have still many more memories, many more memories more experiences of all her achievements also, that are yours because
they achieved things thanks to the support that the parents can give and the dedication of well of everything you are giving up, not like you say good well you are leaving to one side
maybe your most personal thing is, your career, your profession
yes
Well, my name is Claudia Ivette. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking to?
Hello. My name is Juan.
Oh, nice to meet you, Juan.
Nice to meet you, too. Where are you at?
From where, you mean?
Ah, where are you?
Ah, I'm here in the the States, in Idaho
Uh-huh
It is in a place called Robert East. And you, from where are you calling?
Ah, okay. I'm in Texas, in San Antonio.
Wow. That's a little far.
Uh-huh that's where we are at. Hm
Yes, yes. Well, I see we have, well, you see we have to touch on the theme of movies.
No, yes.
Well then, much of the classification part I don't understand much about, I know there are movies that are PG 13, PG
Uh-huh.
The truth is that I've seen some that really have more profanity that are PG-13, ah they are like more violent and more
More like those that are, they are like PG, PG13 I've noticed.
Uh-huh, ah.
So I really don't understand much of this.
well mmh look that I don't aha I have not paid attention to those, those ratings
aha
I end up not understanding them very well
aha
it seems that they are eh, a little complex, they would better have a little more information than they have.
yes, yes it is true
no in general since I have little children
aha
eh children then I don't worry much
aha
for those ratings I worry in any case, because when we are going to see a movie that is a movie that is worth it, that has some interest and not go to any movie then the rating
aha
I don't care as much as the quality and the comments I hear about the movies, no
aha
that is that is what catches my attention a little, it is, I don't know if this happens to you as well, you always go with do you go alone or do you go with someone
No I am married, I have three hears of marriage and the truth I do have, a boy, he is twenty months
aha
then he is about to turn two years old and the truth it worries me what we do, well my husband more than anything
he for example if we see some movie and the truth we love it, we like the movie for example if it is -PG or -PG thirteen
aha
what is what we most watch, we don't really like, neither he nor me like to watch adult movies so
aha
as far as ~PG thirteen
Ah yes
well sometimes one ~R but it really doesn't get our attention, but for example if there is a movie that we like
yes
we buy it and you have for example, sometimes it has some nude scenes and that - mi husband plays the movie and deletes that part.
ah
and he does it when for example sometimes neither him nor me will be at home so the kids can take he movie and watch it
and the my husband is going to record a commercial or something
aha
then they can really watch the movie because there is not going to be, better they can see movies about cars or full action
yes
but for example, he takes, he deleted a part that was a little pornographic, because you know that even if it's a good movie there's always a nude scene
yes
and sometimes it's not related because
there's always something
we have cars and action movies and suddenly it shows something that up and that's not related but
yes, that was not relates, yes
so that is what he has done because we are going to have other kids and sometimes they will be by themselves and then we can be sure that if they watch a movie
there won't be a problem, but
yes yes I think that in that sense you could be very right
yes
oh to me ehm look that strangely
aha
what worries me the most in movies is the language and violence
ehm yes because it really
regularly because like you say when there is an exaggeration in the language
yes
or in the violence everything else is, the same
yes
so when the movie is like that -R well obviously it is going to have like that scenes of all kind
no yes
those are free, so more like - R seems more than restricted it looks like if you didn't have much information about the movie it is exaggerated in all of the elements
aha no y and besides that for example we have found movies that are for em for children that is ehm they are not about children but to see they are
going from the one for children that is ehm supposedly the - PG thirteen that is for children that are thirteen years old that can see them then but sometimes, they say like you sa vocabulary and sometimes they air scenes
of nudity and that, then I say ah, how is he going to is seeing, well
yes
I don't know I am, I am Mexican
hmm
then and really there for example even ah like still in the television they care about you and even at the movies they care about you like a little of that
yes well look that
but I say, ah, I don´t know,it does not look to me very
remembering remembering about the movies we have seen lately, well all of them are
very fast hmm
PG thirteen or something like that I don´t know where did he took them because the ones we have here
aha aha
available in theaters right?
aha
they are, they are simply not good
not yes
then not, we we care a lot about that information as my children are teenagers we always go to the movies together but
aha
we mostly go because of the movies quality
yes
he, in that sense the classification they have here to guide us about the movie, well it does not really give information
not sometimes it does not tell you a thing,because sometimes for example it says
we don´t care about it
and, and for example changes things and when you are already watching it, is, is different at what it says
aha
Oh yes, for example, he says it's too violent, sometimes it's not so violent, it simply, no, no, sometimes it doesn't really give you the information
then sometimes it doesn't
yes
then sometimes you don't listen to it because because, no, and those, for example
yes, no, eh
those things they sell, for example, they sell for television sets, that, that, you see, that
that
that remove the swear words, or things like that, well, sometimes they work and sometimes they don't really work, well, I really don't have one
But I have a friend who has one, and she says it really hasn't worked properly, because sometimes it covers up the words, words that are not curses, and leaves the curses there
yes
then, uf
you see, in that case when we, for our kids' education
yeah
we've never done an act, an action of censorship, we
yes
what we've tried to do is when strong scenes come up, we try to discuss them, no
yes
we discuss them and we say if they were, because that's usually what worries us, we say, hey, that's bad, we shouldn't have watched it, the language was pretty ugly
yes yes
we don't, we analyze it and then we use it as part of our kids' education
yes
in general it wor- it works very well for us because or it worked, not now, now they're grown up.
yes
and what happens at this stage, is that (s)he has a very good judgement about movies no, and
yes look it's true, that's a better idea I remember that my mom when we watched a movie, as well we didn't watch a movie after ten at night because
we already knew that we could find
uh huh
or my mom risked finding ugly movies
uh huh
of the type that it's no longer suitable for some kids but for example sometimes she said, I don't know they played a movie and I don't know one or two curses
yes
or something that isn't so nude but still, for example few clothes and when we were little for example my mom
uh huh
no daughter well soon you will understand more and she told us.
yes
because also as well then if one says no turn around, no no you shouldn't watch that like then a a teenager or a kid, starts to, ah but why doesn't my mom let me?
sure
If it's a movie in the house and I'm going to watch because my mom didn't, didn't let me watch that part
yes no and it's that they'll always run into it on the way, they'll always have the opportunity to watch all that
then I think that no yes yes
but the thing, the thing that if talking about these questions is that the editing or the information that supposedly ought to be censored or
yes
That type of thing never seemed a good to me because
sure, sure I believe that
Well there is a lot of other information about the movies that are appropriate to go to see with your family
yes
and after the movie mention all that happened and educate them regarding the type of movie, the message, the quality with which it unfolded, etc., etc.
yes, yes, that is true.
Because the restrictions that they put, well, many--like you say there is violence that is in a cartoon
sure
There are cartoons that are for all the kids and have too much violence, right.
yes, and those are not upfront about the truth
Sure, exactly, and in those, and in it, and in general it seems to me that 80% of the movies are so bad that one should not watch them.
yes, sure, sure, right
no and as for the others, well, the best ones are mediocre and less than 5% are worth seeing.
yes.
Right, but with these, one already has a sufficient idea to have, an idea of what there is to go looking.
yes
If there are enough, one doesn't want to day that there are not enough movies, but they do so many that there is no need to go to see all of them.  It's, it's...
yes, that
no and then
yes, that
if we would take the care of investigating who they are before going to watch a movie
aha
read the reviews about that movie and then go watch one
yes
it's like, that's what we always try to do when we go out to watch a movie
aha
and we have made a decision about which movies, my kids, since they were young, they've been educated because my wife and I, we love movies, so
aha
even when we were, when they were younger
yes
we would take them to watch movies even if they were movies for grown ups
aha
and they would watch some scenes, strong ones, but a scene doesn't necessarily make a whole movie
aha
so, we would try to speak about the message, no, for example, lots of war movies
yes
lots of war movies are respecting the soldier's
yes, good evening.
Good good evening I am Joe
What is your name?
Joe
Joe?
yes, and what is your name?
Alex
Alex, where are you from?
Ah, eh, I am here in Los Angeles I think that we talked before about religion.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, of course, I remember, I remem-
We talked on October fourth, a while back already.
Eh, what a memory. Yes, yes I remember, how not.
Where are you from again?
I am from Colorado.  Ah, Denver, Colorado.
Oh, yes. Yes.
Well, and what do you think about tonight's topic?
Ah. I, I watch television, by quality not, not ratings.
yes, me too, I don't pay much attention to ratings, besides that I am an adult of course I have a daughter who
is always paying attention to what I watch and I don't want her to see programs that eh, that are going to giver her nightmares or bad, ah motivations but yes there is a lot
a lot of permissive things on the for example, movies from outside, because each time they are, I now think it is more violent.  I don't  know if
It's already sufficient for classifying it as they are leaving good violent movies with many themes
yes, No, I I think that my interests in moves and television at times are based on the theme that they have
yes
Now if it's a violent theme and it doesn't have quality then it's not a good movie but if it has something along with the violence and if they are teaching something.
like a documentary or something valuable about life
I understand
but one can't deny that the truth is the truth
I understand
One can't live live with closed eyes.
Like that movie that was about allies that left the war in Iraq, that thought that the soldiers that experienced it had left
It's about the black actor named Jamie, I think Jamie Foxx
yes
and while this other while guy thought that he was traumatized or something with his experiences in Iraq. These things are very real and happen all the time.
And these movies can be criticized politically.
yes, I'm sure
You always felt that the Bush administration was obsessed with war.
yes
with Iraq and cheating the public
yes they were transferring many things out of the life that they told to invade Iraq as being real, ah now that one lie was not real.
It's not worth what was done, it has already killed more than two thousand soldiers.
It's, those movies are important because most of the people are ignorant about the things that happen in wa-, in life
they have no information
yes, that's true.
Information, the one we have is just propaganda, so, it's important to have another points of view of what is going on in the world, and not just the point of view of the Bush administration.
yes, that's true. Well, I, I think that the current classification system is relative. I know that kids of around thirteen years old, they know what X-rated movies are
right, that's pretty obvious. But, this, I think that nowadays they are stretching what is allowed and what is not. Eh, eh, I agree with the fact that
lots of movies, right? They don't have a sense of, many of them are about gangs, about lots of gangs or gang members, and they go to watch them because it's like
Mhm.
they need to watch that kind of violence.
Those movies are wrong.
yes, they are pretty bad movies.
They've got lots of violence.
And they kind of glorify it, in a way.
yes, and they produce them not to teach us values, but to sell
And that shouldn't be used as a way to sell
them to certain people.
so, that's why I think that those young kids are copying those ways of dressing or walking or expressing themselves, it's like they've become their heroes
and that's so wrong, that's destroying our young people. Those shows, those movies, they teach them false values, it's so wrong but our
society, the parents, families, they have a lot to do with it, they should help the children understand what those things are and how to avoid them, right? I talk to my girl and I don't, when
when I watch something like that, I don't want her to see, I don't eh, I mean, I try, in a way, to say, okay, don't watch that
or, I try to teach them in a very educative way, why it is not good for her to watch that show, so, instead of trying to force it upon her, in other words
Oh, I, I also have a fourteen year old son.
Mhm.
and when he comes over to visit me, I have to turn on the parental control on the sex channels.
Oh, yes.
yes, because he's obsessed with that, when I go out to work, he watches that.
yes, it's easy
So, I turned on the parental control and he can't do that, I've controlled it but I have it under control, it was my idea to control it.
yes.
It's not because of the rates. So, it's a parent's job, every mom and dad must decide which shows their kids are able to watch and they can't put the blame on the classifications.
yes, exactly. Well, in my house, I only have basic cable, I mean, I don't have any channel that, that could go over the top.
Do you have teenagers?
I don't, I only have a girl, she's five years old.
Ah, yes, a girl.
so, I have like, a Disney channel that she loves to watch and we also watch the Discovery Channel, she really likes that and this other
comedy show that it's not that bad, we watch them together because she loves to laugh, she loves funny stuff.
but, when things go over a certain point, if they go over the top, well I won't let her see that because I don't want her to  learn bad stuff
They use it to keep us entertained but when it's morally wrong or, not socially right
yes, you can teach your kids but the reality is that you as a father can't avoid reality, specially when
they grow up because they will be presented with lots of temptations, the ones that we didn't have.
yes, e-
Not because we are not good parents but because of the culture
The culture is more
because the culture today with teenagers are ah, gangs ah, hip hop music lots of sex, lots of violence
Viceos
Videos
yes, all those things
and ah it is not easy to control everything you try and you, I try to explain what, the consequences if they get into this
if he wants to do that if he wants to have sex with a girl these are the consequences that that he might get-, what might happen, you understand?
yes.
You have to, uh, talk to them all the time because some things I have seen with parents because I am a substitute teacher in schools
yes.
they take care of the children a lot when they are five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten years old, but when they are growing up and need more help from the parents I don't know what  happens to them
they start to fail and these kids have more temptation and
the teenage years are a critical age
and it is at that teenage stage where you you have to intrude more in the life of the kid
Exactly
not only when he is five or six years old.
It is that the way of reasoning and thinking, they say, we were teenagers too, I remember how I acted in those years in
that I had a rebellious spirit and all those things but it is one needs the parents' guidance the most.
E-, Exactly. Exactly. Then it all depends on the parents' education, the way they care about the kids' lives,not, not on the classifications
the classification is only a number
yes. And if you think about what's like when they're alone with their friends, they can watch anything they want because there's no one there to forbid it
yes
Eh, but if you help them giving them good bases, about what's good and what's bad, that will help them a lot to think before
taking a wrong action
You have to give the kids some foundations, what's good and what's bad, not only when they're 5 or 6 years old, but also when they're 15, 16, 18 years old
Exactly
and it's more important when they're 15 than when they're 5, because when they 5 they'll follow the easy rules
yes
but when they're 14 or 15, it's another story, my man
and they think they're independent, that they don't need their parents
Yes, they have friends already, they're involved in the culture
yes
mom or dad have to work, they don't always have time, it's very hard
yes, the influence of kids today is very big, I, I agree, although I remember I also had my, my influential friend when I was a kid and all that
but I can see that because of technology and all that it's even bigger now. Because really, movies in my time, when I was a kid, they weren't as violent as they are now
we also didn't have videogames, TV was a lot more restricted, we weren't taught about all this modern violence, neither the blood or the body like the ~C ~S ~L and all those shows that are classics
that teach things like they are real
Hmmm
Well like it is, eh for young people their mind gets used to seeing that like it is acceptable but at the time when I was growing up, those things were taught and would have caused chaos
in fact it wouldn't have been permitted at all, but it is true, the mentality is changing and because of that eh, young people have a great deal of influence.
big and negative of of these things that are allowed in society. And I then
yes.
I, I hope that when my daughter gets to that time of, of adolescence then that I am
It is going to, ti is going to be in a short time, my friend.
yes, I know, time goes by quickly.
Time flies
I remember when she was a baby and now she is jumping and running everywhere and learning many new things and she is curious and asking questions
Hi, my name is Marisa from Philadelphia
Hi, Marisa, I'm Carolina, from here, from Los Angeles
Hi, good evening
Eh, well, well, here it's good afternoon
Hey, that's true, it's three hours earlier, yes
Ay, I was thinking, my god, how can it be? Hey, today we got a very difficult subject
Very difficult, yes
Ay, dear girl, because I'm from Venezuela
Hmm
Where are you from?
I'm from Spain
Ah, okay
Well
And you know right now we're living a very critical moment, with the United States and the, our new president
yes
and then, ay, dear girl
Some-, well, something similar happens to me, I don't have a lot of positive things to say about the US, because I, uhmm, I'm not a left-winger, anyway, then
Wow
The, the United States thing is
It's complicated, it is
It´s very ug-
strong, or even, I don´t know if you casually have, uh, seen a page called, uh, TV for All
and you can watch TV channels there
No
from all over the world, including, of course, Spain
Ah, yes
It´s like this, T - V, uh, T, uh, V, a four
T V for all, Oh
yeah, a four, four and all, A L L, as in television for all, something like that
Oh
uhm, you can watch there, and casually, we, uh, have been watching a particular channel from Venezuela
Hmm
and it´s a channel, of course it´s state owned, but now really it´s owned by the state, not like before, that was owned by the state, but almost as if it wasn´t
hmm
Now we can see the, really see the truth, what´s really happening, what they never told us, and especially about our president, who´s really
as we say in Venezuela, loud and clear
Hmm
I don´t know if you´ve had the chance of hearing him speak some time
I think so, on TV, yes. After what happened, after the Summit of the Americas and all that happened there
Exactly, exactly, then
yes, yes.  They play it here, in, in Philadelphia a ca- there are several Hispanic channels the usuals well Telemundo, Univision
Aha, the same.
Galavision and all that.
Same here.
And you hear everything, yes, and
But you know that those people, unfortunately, well no I mean, they put what is convenient for them, I
It is not that, and also here, here everything is controlled by the government, I mean, let's say
Exactly, exactly.
eh, only, we hear what-, what they want us to hear.
Correct.  Correct, and they play, even this, sometimes, they twist
Mmh
they twist what is happening and then always I find myself with people who, for example, tell me damn, what do you think of the crazy man you have as a president? and
I ay, dear mother, they went there again.  Well, the truth, is that I with completely agree with that crazy man, ah, well I want to
I wanted to say, that, so later they have said a few stupid things, no?
Mm.
and I ay, my God, I took patience lord, because it is a really important topic, delicate
yes.
even now, I have had a, several inconveniences here eh, with even with, with Venezuelans.
Mm.
eh, people who have been here many years and do not know what is really happening in Venezuela.
yes.
besides that, they are afraid of the agreed idea, what communism, that I don't know how much Fidel and that and the other and
well, really I don't know, how much knowledge do you have but this one, for example, the situation we are living in Venezuela is a very especial situation.
Uhm.
my own Venezuela, either way it has nothing to do with the Cuban reality, whit what happened in this Cuba, is how it is, they are
they had to adopt that system ah,what were the needs that carried them to undertake that system and, what happened during the time in which
this, they were applying because evidently they were mistakes as in all things, just as we have mistakes right now.
yes, sure.
We have been making mistakes, however, for we are working based on that, as the president says this, clearly has a complaint against
the government, not against the country but against the government here that,are the one that
Sure.
for they assume policies as it seems to them, as best as it seems, arbitrarily ah
yes, that or not, the fact, in reality, as the question may say, the world police, they make themselves the
Exactly.
Leaders of all, and and they tell you what will happen, and if you don't agree, by force, you you you have to agree
Exactly. right, or if not, then I'll, I'll bribe you.
Uhm. That's right.
Yeah, then wow, ah
With embargoes,with all and whatsoever, by force, with violence, ah, with war.
Right. Right, then this a situation that is highly
This
delicate, but I believe, and from what I've seen, the North American community is waking up in some way, I feel
Mm.
that there is a little more people that are realizing what is really going on, because they also had them in a bubble
There is still much left, and that is what, gives me more
yes
rage because its so clear, tell me- if you know two plus two is four and you can see how the people are being manipulated.
Sure.
and you try to tell the other person, look it's like this, like this.. don't you realize?  And then they tell you no, because you are
liberal, or communist, that is they
Sure.
you get labeled and
hm, labeling continues, and bad ones by the way.
Bad, bad, you are this, you're a terrorist, or anti-, get out of here, we don't want you, if you don't like...
Correct.
and I say, but ah, this country is not bad, it is the leaders that are bad.
Exactly, that is what they tell me sometimes, "what are you doing here?
yes,
and I say, look, I could be in Venezuela and not support that president, or, the fact that you are in a
country or not, or you leave your country does not imply you have a position
Mhm
no one knows the reasons for those people being here
Yeah
eh, at a certain moment but that has nothing to do with the opposition because how many people, for example, in Venezuela don't live in Venezuela, and what they really do is put them some enema
to Venezuelan government and their people
Mm
right so, you don't have to be here or there to support or not, like it's a position very um, to me, when they tell me that way, i get a good laugh
yes
because, what do you do over here ? all right, could be same as you, thank God. You being here, and not in Venezuela
No, but him, to in Spain is almost same thing, what happens is different, the left-wing government, but if it was a right-wing government they could have another mentality
the people, when they do not agree they fill the streets, manifest themselves and leave those here because you never see it, i never saw it
Right, correctly, no. You could look at the gas prices problem, like it truly was, but look
Oh, mhm
for really unusual high price, the people can't cope with that, they don't protest either, and i say, my God, what's happening with all those people?, like
supposedly you, only react when your pocket is affected, but it seemed like no, i don't know what happens, they must have been changing cars to get a more economic one, don't know
yes
i don't know what happens, but they don't have like, in general, the necessity to protest before certain things
yes
however i tell you,  don't know, suddenly here, you live in Pennsylvania like you told me, right ?
yes, Philadelphia, yes
In Philadelphia.  I don't know, but here I have felt that there is a little more, like people are starting to wake up
Mm.
I feel that they are rejecting the policies of, of, of the current president, and like they are seeing that really things are not how they are painting them to be because
me too, at the beginning there wasn't I didn't have access to that, to that page I said, My Good, could it be true what they are saying about Venezuela? But I talked with my friends
and they said, no, girl, what is that? Look, and I, damn really, but look the power of television is
yes.
very big, well precisely talking about that topic, power
Power, yes
and television is a huge power.
yes, they are the ones who control, I say, yes, here
Of course.
eh, Philadelphia is a democratic city, everyone is a Democrat, but the rest of the state is Republican and people, well, look, gringos, from from small towns who are told things
I don't know, very, very ra-, very radical
Correct
so very religious, very closed, o yes, then
yes, yes, yes, yes
No, will be able to, will not change, then while that does not change, and then
Of course, of course, what do you do there in Philadelphia?
I well I, with my husband here no, we moved about a, a year ago, before we lived in Florida and ah
OK.
Over here looking for work, we have, we have just moved and
Oh, and do you think it is best over there than in Miami?
we are in the process of Mh, well I would like it more, what happened is that it was the, the, the issue with work is better here on the north, on the south it is very saturated
Okay.  Okay
And, what are we going to do?  That is, work is the main thing.
Of course, of course, and fi- and come over here  And what do you do?
He is ehm, is, work in in the pharmaceutical industry, doing, clinical research, ahm
Okay, okay.
and me, well look. administrative work, ahm, volunteering and
Okay. Whatever, whatever we can find, of course
well whatever, whatever I can find, Of course
But, and do you have much time here in the United States?
Well twelve years.
Twelve?
Hmm
Oh, my word.  I have been here six, and and we are about to return God willing.
ye, when I arrived, Bill Clinton was there, that the country was in, in a, in an incredible stage of a lot of work, everybody was happey, the economy was going up
yes, of course
then the republicans came in, ehm, with Bush and everything went to hell, like they say
yes, sir, yes sir, and
It goes of little by little and that, is one, whole world. Spain already is
yes
when i go to Spain, everyone, at my, my husband, he is american, they watch him bad and say to me, they have lot of resentment, because they say, look your country is
is ruining the world, they want to have it all, and
Ay, my God
they think that, you know, they think they are you know, the owners of all
yes, yes, yes...
and there is resentment of the power
yes, and i believed that too a little, and, now i understand that is not that, is like us, because we don't have
any fault of our, what the government does
Right
Then, I also before saw the Americans like gringos, then this one, now i understand that don't, that they are Americans and united states, because that is another wrong concept they manage, no ? Then,
Aha
right, we are Americans too, in case we go
Right
and, then when i start thinking a bit and no, no, they're not the not north-americans, no, is the politic of the Government, yeah right, what they do
they decide, do, then you, like, you reflect it against you people and you country
Mhm
but isn't like that, is the state and the politic of, of the Government
yes, i don't like that, I'm Spanish and American, i was here for necessity, looks like pleasure but to me it
Sure.
ehm, and I have to put up with and I have to put up with what the the government does, but I don't know either, I don't like it, it is a
Sure, sure.  yes, no, and you have, one has its right precisely, because you are in a democracy you have the right to protest
Of course.  Well, but theory, practice, don't say anything, or  but
I.  Oh, exactly, exactly, not me, I hope that this, it, it
Mm.  Is is like a regimen, yes.
does not affect nothing the, ehm the project ehm linguistic but, well, at least it is a very controversial topic, when I heard
Very
the toic, I was dying, I would say
I
why?  Why?
I say, I am going to talk to Bush, because you see that I have so much, so much anger that I have to talk to BUsh and put him in a bad spot because
But well, thank God, that you are not alone.  I hear so many people that say,it is not that they talk but rant about him and I say
yes, yes, yes
certainly people are already finding out, besides that
What is what
they think that people are so dumb that they are not going to find
Hmm
how many outrageous things that they are doing, for the love of God
No, outrageous things and then, and, and their, everybody puts their hands on their, their heads, oh my God, this can not be, I don't know what
and no, they forget about the topic the following week
Certainly.
the news on the television, they will say anything to distract the people to get them to forget
Sure, look. Yes, and you know that just recently they ended the film festival for Latin America
Mhm.
and indeed, it became a movie, in Argentina, but the directors were Spanish
Mhm.
and then, very interesting, because you know that the Spanish film also had many protests at the showing of the film
Yes.
documentary style, wherever you
Mhm.
Well, my name is Ibet, and you are..?
Mercedes speking
Hello Mercedes, How are you? Where are you from Mercedes?
From Honduras.
Oh, from Honduras?
Mhm.
Wow. I have a sister-in-law who is also from Honduras
Ah Where from?
Ay no, no I don't know, but I know that she is also from Honduras.
Ah, that's great
yes, it is.
And, where are you from?
I am from Mexico.
Ah. Where from? The Capital City?
From the City. Mexico City. Yes. And
And what do you think aboout today's topic? is it easier to break with someone young or, the age makes a difference.
Mm, look, well. I already went through that stage and I am married, but for example ah mm, I don't know. The experience that I had , was very difficult.
I feel that it is difficult when you really love the other person, when you don't really love is like anything else, okay, it is fine, let's finish, OK
Parting ways
Aha
Then, I think when you really love the other person but in this case, I imagine it's because you did not get along with the person
or because really I don't know, maybe they did not want get along between between the two of them, I think that must be it more than anything
and a communication between the relationship
Um
I mean between, in the relationship. If there is not one, one of the parts starts to not tru-, there is going to be un-trust and starts
to deteriorate the communication, then I think that could be the reason of the break up but if, I know, I feel it hurts
did you ever have a difficult break up?
Um, then. Eh, really yes, yes, yes, because for example, before I married my husband eh, I was with a person and, for example, eh
the same, not for a long time, but the fir-, eh, the first, my first boyfriend
yes?
then this
It's always difficult
Did not last long with him, not a long time but the first ilusion I had, I don't know, and I was that, have told, well, and I said not, becasuse with him I'll get married
eh, I'm going to have 3 kids and building castles in the air and when he came once and told me, you know what? here we are over
what?
Um
I think there was, he had more experience to say, here is the end than I was able to, uh I think for him, um
it was not that difficult, but for me it was
Um
and, then now yes, everything was for good, because I met to whom now is my husband and wow, is much better
the truth.
How good.
Then, I don´t know.
That means that you have only had two boyfriends.
That is, and
That´s good. It´s better.What for? Trouble, to get in trouble
And you?
when there is not need.
yes, and how does that happened to you?
Well, let me see, ah, yes me too but not long ago, I don´t go through that, but I don´t think that I had a difficult experience any time. lets see, I think that
Aha.
With a boy I was with, ah yes. With the first boyfriend I had, we were together for about two years
Aha.
Hmm, I remember that we just decided that it was over, I don´t remember the exact reason of our breaking
Aha.
but is this one, ten years ago.
Wow.
I was nineteen, eighteen.
Are you married now?
yes.
Oh.
And, then we, well, we stopped seeing each other. Later, that wasn't too hard because we were apart, I mean, he lived in one place and I lived in another.
Aha Aha.
Later, with another guy, with whom I went out with, we also went out for a few months he also didn't live where I, where
Aha
were, in the university where we were and he returned to his country of origin
Aha
and that was also easy for the fact that you stop seeing him and, I mean, is easy, really
yes
in that way.
yes
Eh, What else? Let's see which other one. After that I didn't have any other formal boyfriend until S- yes, the truth is I never had any bad experiences I don't know, really? Thank God.
Aha. No, yes, is that sometimes, I don't know, well, for example, I think that in, in my case eh, with the first person I think I grew too fond of him.
well, it was a lot
Mm.
more than, how he felt towards me, I think. And it wasn't that long, I think it was like two or three months.
Mm
But, all the same I was like in the clouds because they use to say, ah, this is my first boyfriend and I would probably get married to him and stuff like that,
yes.
and him, and I don't think he thought like that, he would say her, I don't know if I was his third, fourth, fifth, I don't know
he said yes, well, I won't marry her, I will date her and I will get to meet her and that's all. But, I think, I was the one that had a lot of hope on that
yes, that hurts, really.
I know.
Yes, it hurts because I think that you are all excited and have lots of faith in this relationship and when someone comes and rejects you, well you
I think that it must hurt a lot more when you are already living with that person, like in a marriage.
yes.
I think that must be one of the worse, I think, experiences, yes, I hope, I hope I never have to go through that cause we don't know, right?
Mhm.
So, I hope that I never, so far, I've been married for three years and everything is going on well, but it's all so
Thank God.
Lots of communication and things like that.
But, you said before that nothing is perfect, that's true, always and besides that,
yes.
there's people that makes mistakes and thinks that, ah, marriage is about, according to the times, and all nice
No.
But you live with people night and day and people, I mean
yes.
it's impossible to have a perfect relationship, right? A situation in which
No, yes.
yes, one loves the person but it's impossible to be at peace all the time, that's what I mean, right?
yes
Because one, then I, I am one, is a human being and one has to, things that bother to other people, right? and
yes
see-, to any other people, since I'm not saying to the person with who one is particularly, but any other person, then I know
eventually, then, we have a day, no, is not coin for everybody, all day, twenty four hours a day, for the rest of the life, then
That's it
yes
yes, the truth I fe-, I think it has to be some truth, eh it's difficult eh, keep all happy, right? but
Um
and I think that also and I think, eh, when you take your relationship, for example you know and according, you get to know the person
that, of course, you don't fully know, right? until you get married with that person but I think that I think
if you see that you don't gel along with the person for example, I've met persons eh, that hit their partners being partners, they hit it, and abuse them and force them to their will and then
I think that those relationships will never get to a good place, because if they are not married yet
and try
and they treat them that way imagine how it's going to be when they are married, not so much they are going to say you are my owner and that
yes, yes
the way they already treat them I think that that one, those relationships eh, I don't think they are going to work ever, I don't know. Or he changers or
or changes or the relationship is over, I think that a relationship that way. then I think is not going to hurt at all, the opposite
you have to rest if you have a boyfriend that hits you or that
Um
You are going to rest you will say ay,good that finished, don't know and I believe that if for example everything starts to go good and all
everything is wonderful and all of a sudden someone, don't know they need to go for example to another country or would have to go to another school,I believe that there it would hurt a little
yes
Because,everything is fine,but only for third circumstances, well they need to seperate,then I believe in this type of relations,well yes,yes it hurts but if it's  relation then is
That they hit you abd things like that well no
Ah no yes that Pe-y lo what it is eh,ironic is that Eh those are the usuals,sometime those are the hardest relationships
for that,for the persons that are en-wrappend in this type of relationship
that yes .
Because usually well eh,the people now when they are in this type of situation is like their autoconfidence is very low
yeah
and then, they think that the people think that not that is the best that one time it will let eh what I can reach
i have to take it I have to keep on taking it well
yes
and then eh for real it is not easy like we think that ah he did this i will send him through a tube,no
that yes
is hard more so,because uh it becomes like no is like what,not to say addict but at that type of situation of what
the drama is al-eh lots really? and then the people don't know how to get out the cycle of ,of abuse is what happens
that yes,yes yes it's true you are right because
yes but
for example me at one time while I was in Mexico,I met a girl that eh one time she came with black glasses to her tra-to work.
mhm
And i told her, now your wearing glasses? and she had a black eye because her boyfriend hit her.
ah
And i told her, you know, i think you shouldn't let yourself get touched by
Your boyfriend because and she said it was to hard to finish their relationship. and i asked why, and she said
even though things happen i love him
mhm
and then i said wow, what? how can you love a person that hits you? she sometimes came with bruises or sometimes
ah
he smacked her, things like that
oh, no
like you said, sometimes those kind of relationships are the hardest ones, and when she finally did it, she cried and cried everyday.
She cried during break and stuff like that, because she missed and stuff. so i think that yeah, sometimes um
some relationships, i think that for her was very hurtful.
Carolina
Fabiola
What's up Fabiola?, How are you?
Fine, and you?
Nice!, Where are you?
In Washington
Oh my God!, really far!
And you?
I'm in Los Angeles
Oh
Yes
Opposite directions
In the complete opposite, oh well.., Where are you from?
Chile
Where?
Chilean, from Chile
Oh, Chilean, Okay, I'm from Venezuela
From Maracaibo?
NO,Why, do you know people there?
Yes, I know some people from Maracaibo
Oh, I see, I see.  Well, you know that they have a stronger accent. No? It's like, look and you Mm
Ehm, yes, yes
Aha
look and you  Are you arepa?
A- yes, yes yes. And how great, how great.  Because, sometimes it is so difficult to find Venezuelans, and, and, they say, no no, we really know very few Venezuelans, this and that, and me, oh, my God
We are few of us around here really.  But, like in about a, mm, it was, mm about ten years maybe, I think that they have, mm increased
yes
Hmm
I kn- yes, a girl from Venezuela, and, in Houston.
Hmm Oh Do you work at the Hilton?
No, no, no, no, no, In Houston in i-
Oh, I heard you at the Hilton.  Oh, my God.  Oh, okay, okay
Texas.  No, no, no.  I work at home.  In my home.
Okay, okay, perfect.
Do you work?
yes, I work with deaf children.
oh
Aha, well o- now, to tell you the truth, I am working with the parents of deaf children Hmm
What a great jobo.
Hey, yes.  Rather hard.
Yes. But, eh, it gives you satisfaction to p- have
yes.
to be able to help people.
Exactly, exactly. And I did th-, the same in Venezuela, only that, eh, I did it with sign language
There I learned the alphabet in, in, ah
Ah, OK, OK. Chilean, of course, no?
I learn- yes, yes.
Mhm.
But, in signs.
Mhm, right. But, here, it's oral.
Oh, here my daughter taught me the alph- the alph- eh, some words.
OK
Not all of them, some like I love you and things.
Mhm.
Yes. Little words.
Mm, OK.
But, nice.
yes, yes, yes. Now I'm- it's important orally. No? I'm like in the mid- at the other extreme of the of, of, mm, of the, mm,
of the profession. Because this is a, here they encourage children to speak.
And ho-? To speak?
Um
Without listening, but, they talk, they do
yes, no, yes. Because they, um, with auditive auxiliaries, the can get to listen
Ah
Then, what's done, is to try to train then auditively so they can recognize the sounds
that's beautiful
Um, Um, yes, yes. Tha's like a, a possibility they have, thus, be able to talk. They'll never be able to talk perfectly, he, you, you'll feel the difference talking.
But, definetively they'll have that option, then. And even, eh, there are paretns that combine, the signal language with the oral part, No? depending on
the degree of auditive lost of the, the , the child. If it's too profound, where there are no possibilities not even with the best surgery, then, there
eh, the signla language is used as a complement
What a difficult taks for the parents
Um, it a hard taks, truly. It's really, really hard. But, is good, eh, gratifying. Then, at the end, eh, it has a reward, though. Of course, they really have to, as we say, they have to "turn on the batteries".
Because, otherwise, um, well, hardly, then they'll get it, then
What do you think about, about the subject they gave us of the-?
Well, look at it, it's a hot subject. Hot, hot, truly. I think that couple's relationships are not easy at all. You have to work with a person that,
that it's different to yo, that comes from another world, another culture, another way of being and then try to have a common project, like,
eh, sometimes is a little bit difficult, no? But, I think love is the only thing that can make overcome these barriers, nothing else
Only if there is, if there is love and a lot of disposition from the couple, those differences  and thoes, um, those, eh, difficulties that can be found at a certain moment,
are overcome, what do you think?
yes. Of course. I think suddenly more than the love and all that. Because, love maybe is...
mhm
you get it with time
of course
and and trying, so then i think you want to maintain a family, you have to want to maintain a family because there's lots of people that love.
mhm
and they are all so young, that the first chance they've got of an opportunity, is to fight, to separate.
correct.
They don't work hard, they love each other, and they love, maybe more than a couple that have been together for more than thirty years,
of course
but, they fight day to day and pass their problems, they don't care about problems.
correct.
and, that's what i think they need, people from today, they need to have patience.
yeah
and think that they decided to stay with that partner, or to marry that couple.
of course.
i mean its forever, even though there are problems, you don't run out for every problem you find.
of course, well, look, that me and my husband, are going to be together for about eight years now
and me twelve.
and twelve, imagine that, i mean we've had critical moments but, never enough to separate, and there's a time where maturity plays a big role, right?
yeah
I, in other moment of my life, had left
So do I
Yes
It would have not matter at all, but
It would have not matter at all, but, nothing at all
As I say, if I fall down, i just put myself up, What's the problem?
Exactly
But now, I think before like three times about it
So, Now I really think and said, He has other things, I try to focus in the good things he has, I say that he is different, he can't think like I do, I should not be mad if he doesn't
But, I can't let this affect me
Of course, I do the same
Exactly, the luckily, well, the first time was horrible, I thought it was the end of the world. And well, there we stood and we weren't treating each other fine, until one day, i said, well, what's going on?
We had like three weeks. We never spend mor that three weeks without seeing each other, without speaking, or sleeping in the same bed
Oh my god
horrible, really horrible, I said, look, you know what?, I think
He have not touch me, he have not get there
Hey, terrible, really immature for our side. I told him, you know what, I think this is really immature
We don't have, i mean, this is not making sense. If you want to continue this project, we continue it, If not, we don't. I love you
I love oy, But, we can't continue this thing, you are following one path and I'm moving to another one. And really believe that I loved you, and it's because that I love you
that I need us to define this. Because this is madness, living in this way. Even more, God will not bless a home like this, so
let's get down to work. Because, independently of how grave a situation might be, that - luckily it wasn't a serious situation, but uh, it was like neither of us wanted to budge an inch
It was pride
Silly pride, because, that
It is of no use
totally. Just the opposite
it only affects
exactly. Then, well, luckily we got back in track. And after that, we had another, and however, this one was smaller. I think the first one was the one that really marked us
and it was like, I mean, I was, like we say here, syrupy. I said to myself, this is it
syrupy is like ready to throw in the towel
yes, Ready to throw in the towel. I said, no, no, no, no, I won't co-, I won't allow that, I tell him. I won't allow that, I mean, you're wrong
If I have learned something in this life, is to look for solutions for things that can be solved
Sure
Because, what will we do with a mediocre relationship? I don't want a mediocre relationship. As you say, there are some people who spend up to 30 years together, and in a crappy relationship
yes?
They, they mistreat each other. Like, you piece of who knows what, like, what's that? Why would I want-?
Hmm, no, it's, a girl, and sometimes they treat each other super nice, but they don't love each other
Exactly, that too
They, they spend their whole life together
yes, ye, yes. Look, a thousand things can happen, really. So many things can happen to a couple, it's, it's a really interesting subject. Because, as you say
there really are people that, they get along great, but they don't love each other. It's like, well, I got used to living with him
Right? you just respect, and
exactly
and, what they want to make is the family, and that is.
exactly, there's some that, some that definitely do what they want, and maintain an image
right?and there's some that say, that love, yes theres no love, no nothing.
Theres no nothing, nothing, its true, they have to speak something ture about love, that's why i tell you, i feel like my relationship, what it was, was love.
because the truth is, with a difficult situation going on, if there was no such thing as love, nothing would have finished, because there wouldn't be no sense.
there wouldn't be sense, in something like love, so then, i feel a lot, a lot of love, and a lot of compromise of what you're talking about,
being there because you want too, because its worth it.
because, of course, nobody is making you, you want to be there, and to support yourself.
exactly, exactly
You can have a partner its hard, and when you do, you have to
exactly
that hardest part, after, is maintaining it.
that's the hardest part, yes sir, and looking, how to be continually there, and have that harmony, like something new, something different, and not fall into the same routine,
uh
but, no there comes a time that you know that, but, the important thing is that you can go out with her,
exactly, of course, noticing it
and that the system could bring you something
of course of course, is your husband from chile?
no, he is from here.
oh, you can guess. like, uh, it's a little more. i mean, it's not like it's harder. really, i feel that love can overcome everything
so easy, i say
you think it's easier?
pa- and, eh, well, for some things, easier
oh, ok, ok. because, my husband is from Venezuela, and
for certain
and sometimes, i say, i say that, that that doesn't have anything to do with the, with the nationality. I believe that these are universal things.
Yes, I think that for me it's easier because sometimes, the, they're very entertaining because I don't understand what he says of he says it touch, then it's not right, not r- no, no point for fighting
very with him, because it makes me laugh
and what, what's what you said?
what do you say? or when we're super b-
Bad
Hi
Hi
Halo
Hi, hi, how are you?
Fin, I'm Viola from Idaho
Oh from Idaho very good, I'm Alicia from Atlanta.
From Atlanta.
Yes.
Oh, how are you?
Fine, and you?
Fine, fine
That's great, and where are you originally... ?
From Chile
Right? Me too
Really?
Yes
Oh, how good.
How fun.
And how long have you been living here?
yes, well more or less in the example I'm there the whole two thousand and three
oh, OK
and his name?, and then came and went clear but more or less in the ninety-one , and you?
I'm living here since two thousand two
Ah, its not much, for nothing, for nothing
not so long ago, recently
and from Santiago surely
yes, from Santiago
of course
and you, where you from?
oh, i lived here
from Santiago too?
of course, there in Santiago and conception
oh, OK
of course
look what, what Small world
yes, just. Sounds good
and some time you are in this? call by phone?
because no, not that, I signed up on Monday to do
oh yes?
And I didn't get more from there
Hello?
Hello
Oh okay
Oh, i wish this wasn't a broken phone, but it is only broken sometimes
Oh, okay
I was saying what i have been taking calls
Oh, are you already calling everyday?
Well, I started at once, I was called four times, but I only could get one of these calls
Oh, okay
yes
I also was called this week, but i was's able to take the calls because
Well
this has been a lousy week
Yes, Of course
Yes
I say to you, this has been
yes
fun, they give a topic to
to talk about, to have something to talk about I think
no ah, yes that most be it
yes, i think so
i though I was thinking that it was like this this this study to create a like what do you call it phone menus and things like that
Eh.
for hospitals and theaters and things like that and then they wanted people to speak about things relating to health and things like that. For example
No, what happens is that they told me that they gave you topics because like that one is supposed to speak about personal issues
Ah, why union shouldn't be or why one doesn't want to do it?
because one shouldn't shouldn't, like, very personal things.
Ah,
Because you never know the other person that's on the phone, because
Ah sure, ah, yes.
so that's why they give you topics to have something to talk about
Ah, yes, I thought it was part of the study that they wanted to hear words in Spanish or from Castillian, what do I know.
Oh, OK
no, but no.
yes, the only thing that they told me is that we had to talk about topics like topics like with no importance but
Sure with.
To have like a topic, not to talk with dirty minds.
Sure, It's the fruit
Well yes.
yes.
Yea. Yes, and do you like it here?
no no Idaho's good for sure.
Eh.
yes I was in Washington near Seattle when I first came to the United States, right.
Eh,
and yea, now I'm in Georgia, I'm in the south, so yea like where I'm at now the the everyone's really here and and what do I know the gangs and I'm here in Atlanta and
go on get out and it's more set here
Eh.
eh but yea Idaho for example as a state it's pretty rural right.
yes it's country and it's all quite country,
yes, I'd think it doesn't really matter where.
yes, it's like pretty it's like pretty it's like I don't know it's like the nightlife, I don't know,
Ah, yea I'd think so. Oh, but here in Atlanta and it's a pretty big city. Supposedly the nightlife should be great but really it's
been two or three years.
Eh.
Uh well so and all of the businesses and all of the bars and all the clubs have to close at two in the morning just think.
Wow, at two
at two in the morning, everything's closed.
Oh, and but why
it is the reason the industry has that well as everything in Atlanta and called Bucks Head
eh
and how, and coo and two, three years ago and thing had its crimes, and three people were killed. was killed three people.
oh
there, then the city's new mayor over to me, so if you good people is killing
oh
but just as it is but it is as if, such a city must have at oblation.
yes, well. and as but roamed beyond people use as car or more action?
ah, is not much car, too self, yes.
us as well because ah out two in the morning is not so
good news is that
if you car or something
clear. is not that how bad is that they prefer such a system have a thousand times as good by a straightforward explanation of the problem of
face and further that
yes
much congestion.
oh, OK
then, of course is like a horrible traffic, or anywhere delay as each other as
yes
yeas, the car
Here it is totally different.
Oh yes like over there.
Well there are a lo of cars.  People have have cars everybody because it is a necessity, something like that
Sure.
because there are no trains. But,
Oh
they are like it doesn't it doesn't take that long, like to go so many places, the, where the city,where I live I is like half of purt Santiago but there is a lot less people, because
It is like that
because you knew here things are like the house are bigger, are farther apart, things like that
Of course.  Of course, it is in or
And I am not in Idaho Falls
Oh, I see I see
In Idaho Falls
I see,
In, I am going to a larger city then,
Hmm
There in a larger city but
Sure.
Where we are not, it is the country
Oh how nice, it is the same as sure.  Ehm and it gave a thing over there like this one what The university of Washington
Ah
we were Latin. And
No here you have arto like cars and all that
Yes already
You have Mexican arto and how it is more than anything a rural place
Mm
they hire some Mexican people like me to do the job in
Ah
on earth and stuff like that.
Oh, right like.
Then almost always all you see is Mexican people. Even they see and the people takes you for a Mexican
Right, yes
less latin, they say ay Mexican
Right, the wheat
The you have to go saying that, no no no
No
I'm not Mexican
Right. Then what i like is that they think that i am like a Palestine or an aquatic thing, yes, if a  go to some restaurants
yes
or if i want Middle East food, they say
Eh.
and they tried to speak to me in Arab, I don't know. They found my face to be more Indian or something, but of course. Is there discrimination there or no?
Uh uh. Yes, the same, the same but no.
Oh, but
O well yeah, everywhere
ah, of course.
same, more than anything it's about how Latino people are but they do not know how to speak but
ah, of course.
because the same there is a lot of people who are the same that go shopping and do not know anything
and of course, of course.
English and then they have to go around but not like other people, you know how in every place, they are average
yes. yes. Of course.
because over there they are very discriminatory, you know that
Good here it is like super today that Atlanta and all of the south is like sixty percent black, like that.
Oh, okay
Then it is like, now that it is more diverse it is more like that eh, acceptable to my knowledge but at the same time in the south there is the south of the
The United States has a history with being one of the most racist place in all of the United States, in fact here
Oh,
There was slavery and all that, then. It's the same there where a certain minority of Whites hated whichever ethnic group and they had their rare demonstrations and all of those things, but
Ah, well things that were strong, yes.
of course.
They fight hard.
yes but.
Here no, is nothing like massive is a little like kind of unpleasant but not like groups not things like that.
of course for example in the rural areas of Georgia you would see things like you see the Ku Klux Klan I don't know
Oh, yes really.
yes, still.
Oh, mm
And those weird things but is very very far from the city I mean
Eh.
inside the city of Atlanta you are in a more civilized place so those things don't.
Eh.
yes luckily, look what has happened.
Oh, Oh, how weird.
And how did you end up in Idaho?
Oh I married a Gringo.
Oh, of course. An Idaho
yes. I married a gringo, that's how I came here.  And you how, how?
Well my mom married a gringo
oh really?
yes, and so that's why we came to we went to Seattle in ninety one, I was about eleven years old
Mm.
but my Dad stayed in Chile and that's why, I came and go like this.
Oh. okay
Sure.
Mm. okay
And to
okay
interesting
And so you're single now?
Yes something like that, I am like we live together
Oh, okay
Well then sure.
okay Ah, look. And what's this called, do you like it or not?
yes, because I'm inside the city, and I like the city more, perhaps because I'm from the city or the country. For example I was living in San Rafael I don't know if you where that's at but
on they way from San Felipe to the Andes that is like a question more more rural and you couldn't imagine how
Oh
typical Chilean countryside and I loved it.
yes.
It was a village, what do I know. I like to be inside the city because I know there's more going on, like you know, there are more things to do.
More, I don't know, more what I carry is
oh,
so then
oh, okay
yes,
Is not like
but
Is not like instead, like very drastic for me to coming here.
yes, I imagine
because I was used to be living in the city , not, and here, but there is a city nearby, I can find everything that I need but life is more
is more peaceful, to say it like that
of course
more calm and everything, same, is not good because is for example, the, eh, there is not so much crime like in the big cities
of course
but is kind of borring.
yes, I can Imagine
half
same in contact, is difficult also
Here, yes, same but not so much. Not so much. Like when, even, at least less mall, is not too big.
Well, oh, Hi Juan, Marcela.
Hi, ¿how are you?, my name is Juan, Marcela.
Yeah, ¿how're you doing?
Hey, ¿didn't we talk the other day with?
Yeah, i think so, you're in Texas and I'm in North Carolina.
Yeah, i, I'm really glad.
Oh, yeah, me too.
I haven't forgotten you. We practiced together, ¿right?, Hey, but today's heath.
Right.
¿Do you have insurance here?, ¿are you covered?
Uh, I'm covered through my husband.
Uh, uh.
And the children are covered, so we're ok.
Oh, well, look, we're. We're not.
That's a problem, right?
We're not covered. It's a problem, because there's always something that could happen, right?
Um. We're very healthy, but you never know.
And the, yeah. And the other day i went precisely to a, an office in which they supposedly give some kind of, i mean, pension for
people from the community, right?
Yes
And well the papers that they asked me with my address and proof of work. And, finally they found an excuse to not, not giving it to me because they asked me
to give information about the person that was hiring me and at that time well, that person didn't want to give the information, no?
Mm.
and and, in my case, I have a son with epilepsy.
Ah.
And, then he needed some some emergency attention here things that
and didn't they give you, eh, the attention?
eh, no. No, no. They didn't want to give me the prescription. Right. So in the cases that press with him, he was in a bad way once, yes. He became worse.
And then I had to, to return to Mexico and there he was treated by his doctor.
Mm.
And they prescribed him and then once I ran out the medicine here. Eh, normally I buy in Mexico and
yes, but it can be cheaper.
it's a problem the prescription and then a friend who is a doctor had samples and he gave me samples of the medicine
yes, that helps, what a thing.
no? yes, he gave me. Then yes, it's something that we thing about that well, there should be some type of more flexible, no, in order to well in case there is for the community but it's a certain type of community.
yes, No, I think that the whole system will have to collapse before they do things differently. Because I think that it's already too difficult to fix it because there are
the costs of, the cost of everything, depends on demand. And so if those costs keep on going up, up and up
yes, yes.
because there is more demand and because people pay for it. And so the costs keep on going up because people ask for more money. And the people that work ask for more money, it's a vicious circle. And so how can you all of a sudden create a social medicine?
yes.
It is impossible because all these people are already like
yes.  It should be.
The money doesn't stop being like a drug, you see.  They are already used to a certain amount of money.
Uh uh.
And then now, suddenly they are not going to have it.
Exactly.  It is a problem, it is a circle that works with earnings here they are stronger, no?
yes.  Of course yes
Then the interest is wors
We would stop making bombs and going to war.  Look, all that money that could be put
Mm.
on schools or in a medical system, social medicine.
Mm. Mm. Well, they will go just a little bit lower.
Mm. Yes.
With that.  Because here I don't know there where you are living.  But, here if someone has money it is nurses and doctors.  No?
yes, well nurses get paid very well because there are a few nurses you know there are fewer.
Then.  Mm. And well here as they say, you see a good car with a woman who is thirty, for example, no?
Mm.
And she is a nurse and that's how it goes.  When you find out they really are nurses.
yes.  Tell me, twenty, thirty dollars an hour.
yes, yes I Uh uh.  Then who in this case well it is offered.  In Canada I understand well they have much medicine, no?
Um
Then any Canadian resident has the right to medical services, just for being there. And it doesn't have any major real consequences on the economy.
No, but the difference is that they started right.
And it's, um, exactly.
Yeah, it's like in Argentina, my parents have their full medications paid
Uh, uh
All their medicines are paid, they pay a little, ¿right?, but very little.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the other thing, you could at least try to pay something.
Yeah
You're gonna have some kind of insurance, but that's it.
It's, it's very expensive
It's expensive, ¿right?; And then, i don't know how the medications are here, but well, in Mexico they're cheaper and its more like that
in other places around the world. Everywhere around the world.
And there's more competition on the medicines there, for each stuff.
Yeah, there was this medication i was taking, my son took it for a shor while, and it turns out that here there was no medicine, you see, without the brand.
Uh, uh
Uh, and then, uh, we went to Argentina last year, i went to the drugstore and i showed them something that was over fifty dollars here
i bought it there for twelve dollars
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Twelve dollars, the same brand and all.
yes
and it could have been it could have been less if he bought the other brand, the unknown brand one thing
same yes
But didn't understand
And the Mexican case, for example, the medicine of my son are in five, six marks
Mm.
with some ingredients
Mm.
no? yes yes and here there is only one. And secondly the literature isn't the best. And if it is only the laboratories, and I think that all the NorthAmerican laboratories well eh
Then at the time of the competency well here there is a monopoly
yes, yes, yes
Strong interest in all, no?
Truly yes. Truly yes.
Mm.
Well what do I know, apparently that things yes like that
But.
Supposedly what specialty do they have to operate here. Do you know what you'd have to do.
yes.
Why don't you put yourself in contact with an organization that is called Shriners?
Uh uh. ah yes.
Shriners yes
yes, I know, yes, I know.
Ehm, because they help the children.
Mm
Now I don't know if they specialize in a specific disease.  Or if they cover everything because maybe
Mm.
you can communicate with them and tell them, hey we have this child and this is his condition and this is our situation.
yes.
And maybe they can help in some way.  Because Shriners dedicate to help, to pay for the medical care of children that can not pay.
Uh uh.  Uh uh.  Well yes look, yes
of the parents can not pay
yes I knew that.  Hey, we ran out of time or what?
I don't know, they say it is of twelve minutes but their twelve minutes seem like half an hour
Oh, Look that, yes I knew just the and thought that it was for me.  And me younger without gryas and like that for a style more
yes.  Maybe I am making a mistake in not finding out you see it doesn't cost anything.
Mm.  I am going to crash.
And also if you call the Catholic Charities
Uh.  Uh uh. That is true.
maybe they, maybe they have I don't know, a wave or something you see that can help you in a
yes, yes it is very simple because to tell you the truth, well on one hand the maintenance is a medicine that this person that helped me with the sample says no man this
here we are gifted, no problem. Only look for a community center or something
There are lots of samples. And, but knowing a little bit more about the advances. Its because I can give out the medicine we think that one diagnostic more profound could improve the lifestyle of my son with
There are lots of samples. And, but knowing a little bit more about the advances. Its because I can give out the medicine we think that one diagnostic more profound could improve the lifestyle of my son with
with the epilepsy, right?
Of course.
because It had been under control, but lately he has as close to two years that It has been disconnected. He has been out of control.
Mm. And of course he is growing and then possibly he doesn't need this medicine, they have to give him another one.
And, well, yes, they gave him another one. They leveraged him and it didn't work so by no means, he had to take it off and return to the basics.
Mm.
yes, yes he got worse.
what
yes, yes, you know, it is matter of experimenting.
and you, you must live with the heart in the mouth.
well yes, sometimes yes.
and that is a lot of stress.
all the time yes.
a lot of stress.
life without you telling me is always pending, all the time.
Mm. yes, yes. yes.
right? then you know one is always hoping that it doesn't happen. Well I don't really know what really is going to happen, but right it does cause trauma, but poor son of mine because he is a teenager so
Hmm
It happens in school and he feels really bad.
Sure, because on top of that he feels embarrassed. Look, how old is he?
yes, it's a stigma. It's a stigma. What he has, no? then
How old is he?
seventeen
ah, sure, he's a teenager
Eh, yes, well, returning to the subject, I think he should try with some good
yes. Do you know where you can ask around? in the teaching hospitals
System of, eh
With the doctors. The medical centers that have medical schools
Uh
Sometimes the different departments there
yes
they'll see people that, that can't pay in a normal situation, you know? Like us who can't go to a specialized doctor because it's too expensive
hmm
And we don't have that much money
Hmm, yes
And they, they make notes of what they give you. And they charge accordingly. Something that always is, uhmm
reasonable. Something that you can, well, pay. Sometimes they don't charge anything.
Mm.
Of month. and that, is is this interesting. I had to make myself an abscess. I it turns out that I have a thing that is called ADD
Uh uh.
And I for years I thought that I had it but in the end I went an like I had been diagnosed I the same and in the end I found here in the teaching hospital of the University of North Carolina
Uh uh.
and they didn't charge me anything and they did all the exams.
Ah, yes?
yes.
As well it is all good, to which orientation do we go now, because in fact, where I went it is called University System, healthcare system something like that but
Ah, yes then it is that with the
Then just like that there is where they bounced me.
with the University. Ah?
I told them.
Ah.  But what a thing.
Mm. Uh uh.  Then, they told me no well you have to bring us information.  I had a letter about my income, etc., no?
Mm.
But, not that, we need your employer's social security.  And then there was where they didn't want anymore
They didn't want to give you that information.
no? wel not I.  But well then now I have my social security, myself.
Ay then maybe you can
yes.  Employed.
Mm.
I go anyway.
Maybe now you can
Uh uh.
Hello, how are you? my name is Juan
Hello, well eh, Mateo here
I am in San Antonio.  Mateo, I think we had already talked, you are in Philadelphia
yes yes, yes, and you are
ah, look, it is nice to talk with you again
yes, how, how have you been?
listen, well all good this, what do you think about today's topic?
no, I didn't hear it, what is the topic?
the topic are technical gadgets, I mean technology, the gadgets you use the most and that you depend on then and if, how do you consider that dependence
and how do you consider the matter of technology, no?, your daily life, if it becomes more of a problem than a solution or something like that
this includes, automobiles, cars?
it is the same that, it is the same I was thinking, clearly, they should include it, no?
yes because it is a, you know? a machine
exactly, well, but, I said well yes, the automobile seems to be the most important, no?, it is- then I thought maybe it is the computer, but no
yes, the most obvious one is the computer well, but, it is not the only
aha, exactly but sometimes, eh, what seems like a more personal element depending on the case, well it can be the car, no? because the computer is more and more another tool
well more than, than, sometimes, let's say that it belongs to the institution in which you are, no? it is more a work tool
ah
but a tool like very personal seems to be the car, no?
yes, and because of that, the same thing you buy a car and you are always using it and you always have to maintain it, you always have, it is some part of your life
because, you have to be careful with the car and, you know?
yes yes, exactly, besides like I am here in Texas
Okay
I believe that here the car culture is something like a reminiscence of the horses culture also
did you use horses more?
no? is like a horse, it is something like very, very, very personal, very closed
yes
to, to your life. here take care of them and the is as important as, let't say, as the horse at that time, no?
yes
Some years ago and, and well, well if don't say, so in our time of communication the most important devices are going to be the related with communication, the computer
eh, everything that allows the handling of the information and everything, right?
yes, because, here in Texas yes, but even there in Texas
but
You need the car, you know? to, to work
yes
so
exactly and here working people have like in that times like a mule, no? they need a a, a pick up a, truck pick up
really?, yes, yes
pick up truck, right? and listen, and it does not leave them, then is, eh, it is evident, like it is a hard work culture very, very important
right
and the computers, well, in every home there's television, telephone and computers basically, isn't it? but but like there are other dimensions of the technological cuestion, then the automobile seems to be
of the most most important
yes, but... the cuestions on the topic were what
ah, what a- what technical, technological question is more important in your life? that's what we're discussing right now, if it should be the automobile or the computer, what do you think?
well, for mi it would be more my computer and my cell phone
aham, exactly
because, you know? because i have my cell phone and I'm always with it
aham
and, well I've grown accustomed to having a cellphone, you know?
aham
back then, i didn't had a cell phone until i was like twenty, but now that a- that i live in Philadelphia in the city and that I'm not always going back home fo-
not always going back home for for, you know? seeing my messages
yes, yes
well I'm always always, always having my cellphone
having your cellphone
i think it's very it's like surprising that almost everyone has a cellphone here in the united states
yes notice that it is, it's verry important what you just said, some time ago when i was working i had a kind of work in which the computer was the most important thing, was it?
yes
and well, on the computer were the messages, there was always the internet, the mails more than the phone, the cellphone, anything, right?
yes
the computer was the most important
but now
but now,with the type of work that I am doing the car is the most important .the computer because the car is what permits re-type of job that I am doing
more phisical,no? then the car becomes the most important tool and the computer well, in a second plan even though it is also very important no?
well it is because the type of work well
well for me I believe that well you and you where around Texas and obiously you know that there is more how you say? i understand that there is more buildings and stuff around there you know?
LOT MORE SPACE
yes yes
for in the, in the city having a car can be an inconvenience as well.
yes, yes, that yes
because you have to try and park and have to pay to park and the gas station is not close. and I don't know es
is more of a problem then a help because a help but obviously you know? obviously
ah,yes?
better to have a car I think
yes eh,yes because of the distance I have to travel in my work the car is more fundamental
yeah sure
but yes and in the city I believe the most imortant and depending on your work also well eh could be the computer no? then
the the other question o,o the tools of communication no? like you say the cellular.
yeah
and that and eh, and the uestion is if you consider that you are eh this technology becomes more a problem then then in
well, what kind of problems could he have, right? like you said, with the car, the problems that have to do with the parking.
right
no? here in Texas no, there isn't, where I'm from there is not  major problems, no?, with the parking there is a lot of space everywhere, he hasn't presented
Lets say, those problems here, but in the end, I don't know, I don't know what your opinion is, above everything I would say that, well, in regards with the cars, matter of cars and all that well it doesn't look like a big problem unless
we could consider a problem the interests created around the, motor industry and like so sometimes they affect the growing of technology.
of transport, right? for example
right, but don't you think that, that its very awesome that it changed in about sixty years.
yes
a, yes we seen how sixty-five years ago there wasn't any cars, but nowadays everyone has it
yes,yes, yes but, yes
and the same thing with computers they have, they have computers that wont go off the market for like ten years because
well
because they have those things very advanced and the things have not cumbri- have not cum-
yes
charged their development costs, you understand me? I can't explain it very well but
Exactly yes, well like they say too, with the motor industry, right? if the motor industry would have advanced technologically much like the electronic industry then maybe an automobile will let us transport like
one hundred kilometers with one liter of gas.
right
right? and instead of costing like twenty thousand dollars, it would only cost ten thousand dollars.
yes
if that was the case, no? but, like the technology, in this case the industry, has their interests well no, like it does not advance, no? you can see already what they are saying now about the hybrids.
that no, most of them say that they are not feasible and that in reality it is only a matter of image that the companies manage and when the time comes to see the, the scoreboard
regarding hybrid automobiles well I thought that they were going to be much more efficient I think that the efficiency they have achieved is minimal
yes
no?, no, I don't think that they have a real, a real, ehm that it is really a change like that very importanttechnological given the efficiency that
yes, that was an important change
pardon?
you don't think that it is an important change, or
no, I don't think that it is that important at the same time that the efficiency they have proven is not radically different to the ones others have it is very little, no? you see, I say
oh
a, a,according to the rules an economy car drives you it could be thirty-six miles per gallon
aha
and a hybrid can drive you fifty
oh no, ehm yes sure, sure that, there are cares around right now like the, the Fords
oh so
the pick up trucks are good they are changing to be more efficient you know?
OK
but the expedition those cars are big so they are expensive you know? only they can go twenty miles, ten and eight miles per galon or something like that that's a huge expense
yes exactly  but at the same time cars like this, there are some small cars that give you almost the same performance that hybrids and they aren't hybrids no?
by small cars, news that are not in the North American market, they are in the European market or Latino American where they have to be more efficient
oh yes
and smaller no? then if we compare with the spend of a hybrid against a small Europe car or those that run in latinoamerica so
it goes out more expensive have a car for the initial spend and for what you can save in gasoline finally
its less that you have a car very low cost no
and why is that
European
because the united states is one of the ony nations that have this you only have big cars here you know
yes i am yes
there in other countries  have smaller cars its good a different culture you know but
yes i just a few years ago the oil problem, in the eighties or something like that i don't remember
OK
i thought i was having an exchange of culture because they started to develope little more here in the united states
yes but
i thought well i was going to have an exchange of culture but that was nothing by the time no it seems because they have a big cars they keep like
I am Ana Maria
Oh Faviola, hi
Hi Faviola
How are you?
Good and yourself? How is the weather like in your house?
Very nice, sunny or cold
sunny and cold, oh
cold
Over here weather is ugly, it is cold.  What do you think about the movies? Have you talked already about this topic?
yes
I also had that topic before
I did not had that topic before and I had to talk about it, specifically the person I had to talk to talked about violence
mhm
No, he liked the idea of going to see movies.  I told him, the world is the world.  It has violence
mhm
Always had, and have the experience to teach children abroad peace and love on television oh, oh in the world and later when they face the real world which is the school
You find that, little kids hit him, that they do not know how to defend themselves.  Moreover, when you have only children
OK
then oh, I find that it is good the classification they have, I believe that is the adults responsibility, until when the children can watch television
I agree, the maximum responsibility lies within the parents
The are doing their job the one who make movie and
they are earning money, what is your job,
in their business, you
doing their business, yes
yes, now the one who wants it, take it, who wants to see it, do not want to see it, is not their responsibility, they see
of, yes
that sells
yes
And is what they do, it is not their fault, is the fault of the ones who buy
yes, the one who likes the product, for that reason
yes
With you that is the most responsibility, whether is in violence, of sex, of what ever you want to protect a, a child in.  The responsibility is of the parents, even if there is a classification.
Because, if there is a movie classification, for example, PG thirteen
yes
If you have younger child and if you let him/her watch the movie is your responsibility
yes
is because you let him/her and you thought it could be, is that right?
exactly
So then, because I, the the association, or, or, or whoever places, places the classification, already have it then,
I think if, imagine, we think more or less the same in that Faviola because, at the end you realize that the responsibility or raising and take care and of what you want them to see and not see
Your children, or your family. Eh, your mother or your husband like mother
MM i think i totally agree and the other, normally the children have access to television whenever parents are not home
Exactly
children are alone
mhm
And there isn't a father there to show or teach, you can't view this, view that
And if they make a sleepover, you don't know either
Right, no you don't have a clue
If they go a sleepover and they put a movie, watch it in that house without control and whatever
You never know
Exactly
I think the important is give them one. To respect that rules and if you give them good principles at home. Your family, ans show him things
Right
Exactly that i don't like or i don't like it. You must see if you're prepared, the moment will surely come
Why, because like they say, you can't have them in a crystal box
No, and besides
yeah, exposed (boy) or exposed (girl)
yes, and when they reach a certain age. My son had around 15 years and he tells me, Don't worry you've the best you could
mhm
ah, 25% is the genes and education and the rest decision, my life decisions
Look, with that
Sure, then I learned. Oh, wait, no eh, oh, I was and
mm
My cell phone was ringing. OK, OK wait and I'll answer.
OK
Eh, don't hang up because we need to talk for twelve minutes.
yes
It, I only went to turn it off.
OK ah
And about the people, I think, on the movies I love to watch horror films.
Yeah
But sometimes that, that I'm scared, I'm a adult.
You, you scare yourself,
I get scared and I'm going to find out about horror movies.
Yes, yes, but your responsibility is to watch it, and you scare yourself
yes
Yes, I don't like them and I don't watch them, I don't watch any kind like that. That is why it's my decision bec- even if I have the age to watch it, if it's too aggressive, I don't want to watch it.
Yes, that's why, that's why I respect what my son told me that time, fifty per cent is responsibility,
yes
of, of the individual, of the person, eh, you already did the best you could, but it comes an age in boys before they are eighteen
Some are more mature than others,
yes
and they start watching rated r movies.
mm
at the age of fourteen and fifteen, and eleven and twelve year olds are watching pg 13 movies.
yeah right.
and sometimes even kids, and even younger kids, because i remember, my friend jenny had a kid that watched harry potter.
yeah thirteen yeah
PG thirteen PG fourteen, so i say, jenny doesn't like that, she gets scared.
yeah
she's scared of monsters, and all that
yeah
but i agree, that the major part is the criteria that you make of it, to take care of them if they don't want too.
yeah why, why
not just leave them with the tv.
but imagine if you cant control it.
but its only tv.
that's what i mean, you can control it, you need to be more mature, it isn't true.
we need to have criteria formed, to watch movies.
yeah that's why i said you don't get anything good out of watching it, like at his friends house.
aha, in the same school they show them movies.
Oh the same school, but the same school is a little more supervised because that's already another thing. Because they have a purpose.
They show them documentaries.
But what I fear the most is when they go to their friend's house. And they sometimes have the television right there in the room, which is so customary nowadays, or the computer or whatever.
And they have access to information without their parents, without their parents having any idea. And they are in the room their parents think that they are listening to music or whatever
Perhaps they are watching something inappropriate. That's why, I mean what happens, is that if my daughter or son or whatever it is,
faces that situation he has to learn to value himself, And learn to respond to that, That's what I say, in other words, trying to instill in him the home values.
Follow like superman the little boy that climbed on the window and got killed.
of course, because you know they are still not prepared.
that he wanted to fly. No, I want to ask you a question.
aha
eh, did you read the rules that are in this, phone game.
yes Okay
I was asking myself, ah how is this? are you getting ready for Christmas yet?
yes, yes, yes I'm getting ready I'm already buying the gifts for the family. But now I have, I have other things on my mind.
is your birthday no.
yes but, I'm already getting ready, buying gifts for the family at least my nieces and nephews. They're set, we've already bought them their gifts, so I only have the adults left.
Buy something for the adults, a little something, either way I'm going to make the majority of the gifts.
That's what I was going to tell you
I'm going to cook, yes ah
cook and boil. To boil that thing you made, that thing you gave me
yes, for some kids too, yes
Not that, the table thing
yes, the, the, yes, that too, but I don't have time yet, I have to wait until the middle of, to December's last week to do it
Oh, because they are
Because I don't have time before
That's pretty
yes, so that's what I'm going to do too. That's why some gifts I will make, but for example, hmm, Andreita has her birthday soon, for example
Two days before Miranda
Andreita has her birthday too. Oh, three
if she was born on the 25th or 24th, I can't remember
Oh, yes, but I remember it was like three days
Three days, then it's the 24th. Then I got a little gift for her, I bought her the same thing I bought Miranda. Then ,eh
What did you buy Miranda?
Por te pre- one of those screens where you draw and then can erase it
Ah, how nice
Because she likes them, she, she already knows them, and she likes them, she draws little lines and then she erases them, and, I won't give the to her yet because they're very small and she'll put them in her mouth
But meanwhile, you'll give her the pencil and the screen
Ah, how nice
But yes, because little things like that
I'm excited.
Of course, you see, then. Those things like that are nice to do, so I bought the same thing for little Andrea. And that was it,
And you know who else has a birthday coming?
Yeah, who?
On the same date
who?
that I remember from when I was there
My father in law, who
Your father in law, yes
yes, it's true, who?
Him, him, Juan Luis, Sandra's youngest son.
Oh, yes, yeah
Also on the twenty- the twenty ninth. I also remember that more or less around the same date, I remember that they were all around the same date.
I don't remember of his of being in I didn't know at least.
No, you went to little Carlos' birthday. And the one for teh girl.
I haven't gone to any birthday to Sandra's house. I went to only one, but I don't remember, to tell you the truth.
No, you did go once you went to Chile and you left a present, that was for the birthday.
Eh, it was in April, then, when i went to Chile it was April
OK, that was another birthday, she has three.
And I left the present - yes, I left the present right there
yes for a nephew of hers who came later
Of course he came, yes, yes she told me that she had given it to him later, yes. But what his name is, no
No, but Sandra will not celebrate her birthday, she won't have a party that year
no, no, okay
No, she said no, just for the family, because they're going to buy something better for the kid
yes, it's true
And really, she makes parties that are too big
she spends too much, yes
too much, she spends too much on that and they can't buy what they really want for the kid
what they really want, exactly
they, of course. They have to decide between one or the other, so yes, this year, the kid decided he wants just the family
So he can get a more special present
Sure, so he can have one more present
Jua, Juan Luis is the eldest or the youngest?
The youngest of all
ah, okay
And, and he says, I don't want any clothes
Poor thing
I don't want books, only toys
Carolina.
Tamara
Tamara, ¿how are you?, uh
Yeah, ¿and you?
Fine, fine. ¿Uh, where are you?
I'm in Seattle, Washington state
Wow, I'm in Los Angeles.
Oh, yeah
Yes, it's just incredible
Yeah
Right now i was making a phone call, and suddenly, i mean, i didn't think today was sunday, i was more asleep than awake, and i, ¡Oh my god!
Yeah, you caught me off guard. But, ¿have you been participating long in this?
Yeah, this is, i think this is my twenty three call.
Wow, you're almost ready, I'm just about half, i'm going for the tenth
Yeah, and this is the second time i make a service with them.
Oh, ok, ok, yeah, because i got an email that they're taking back people that are participating again, uh, because at first you could only participate once
Yes
Didn't you, you got the same email, ¿right?, i mean, that apparently this will continue, you see, according to what i understood from the email they sent me.
Yeah, i, it's
It's more like, right, tell me
Then, what do you think about what they show in the movies?
Say? Well I will tell you honestly, it's been more than a year since we stopped watching movies movies in the regular cinema and we move to the cinema
not so "Conventional"
aha
We moved to the cinema, for example in case of cinema, no? same as the one on television. Now we watch movies like Documentaries. Well... eh, with a different type of message.
aha
Watch movies that are on on eh, what do you call it? the festivals, there we go for example, the recently finished International Festival of Latinamerican Cinema
eh, yes it was
yeah
Hello!
No, no, I'm here at my computer, sorry
Ah, OK, well approximately a month more or less a month, because since a long- time ago as I tell you we decided that we wouldn't continue wasting our time
time, in most cases really movies have a really silly and absurd content ans well we made the decision well not to, that we didn't want to waste time or money
OK
Eh watching a kind of movies that really don't give you anything
Yes, because there are many movies like that, I have realized
yes
yes, I like them a, near where I live there used to be one of these, ah like a Hollywood Video or Blockbuster but it was like
smaller
OK
back then they had movies like documentaries and things like that but they closed it because the big stores always are around here and people didn't want to go to that,
Right
but those are the best ones, like you find movies that I really like, my husband is American but he likes international movies too, movies that have more
more important things to say
Exactly, exactly
Every now and then, since I've got little kids sometimes there want to go see some movie and we take them but usually no, we have some. We used to go two or three times a month to the movies
ah OK
but now it's not there anymore, so now like one or two times every two months
Okay, yea we don't go a lot either like once a month but we used to go a lot more often, quite often, quite often and one good day we saw a movie really st-
upid, so dum that I felt bad to be there in the movie theater. I, well, what are we doing here? What a waste of time this is
No, no no ; and really all of a sudden we started hearing about other movies and everything that's great we completely left it behind; now we're in a
in one of those
What are you doing, right? I mean to watch that, really I prefer aco- lay down and go to sleep or I'd rather do something else instead of of, no I'm saying all of the movies, there are some that have a
a pretty different message, that's worth seeing but lately I've felt like they're making movies, like to make them
uh huh exactly.
uh huh, like great we have to make ten movies; we're going to make ten movies but it doesn't matter what? When? How it turns out, to the
forget about it, like we say, where are you from?
I'm from Panama
Ah, okay I'm from Venezuela
Oh okay
Aha, yes
in, then yes it's true, it's true
We say thus to "Macha" no, because good, if they make films like they want to but yes they leave good ones leave and others, if they don't leave don't leave but
Honestly no. And the same is passing right now with the television. We had cable and now he just has a question of we cut it to a month because no, I don't know suddenly like
that we put ourselves against what we saw that there was a lot of manipulation of the average ones they only pass the news to you that agrees with them they hide the truth
eh then that is concerning those of the reporters and the films then if that's not one film that's really very good very good
but then they repeat and repeat and repeat. Ay My God! What is this? we are paying for this then it's like an annoyance, right now we have like an annoyance with
with mass media we are thus reluctant, yes yes.
Yes it's true what you say. Here, my husband and I. We see the news.
I think aha.
Because whenever you see something or they give something to you well stupid
Exactly.
or you have it or they exaggerate to you enough
Exactly.
Because, when I was, we were in Panama before Noriega left Panama.
Ay maginate
And we were there and my husband, you know? this white man, paper white compared to my father and my mother is white so I left more than my father, so
when we left you know that he was American.
Logical, logical.
We both introduced, we didn't meet by where we had to go, he had to go to work at the base and I had to go with him or something thus
Of course
and then out of nowhere, we would put on the tv, and there would be a little bit of what has been happening in panama, i would just look at him,
and say hey, weren't we there this morning? i don't remember seeing that this morning.
exactly
and the next day, i would say the same thing, i think they were just showing the thing they showed last week, what.
exactly.
it has arrived since then right, i don't want to believe what the TV says.
exactly.
none of the news, that's what i tell my kids, don't believe everything they say on tv.
exactly
because its not true. and that
look by accident, they lent me a movie called 'the bad of canada' or 'the definition of panama'
ha
this came out when the problem in Norway and everything else came up, the documentary as well, i was shocked, because i didn't image it would have been so sad.
so bad what happened.
that's the documentary about the man the took the guys head.
oh yeah
no no he doesn't remember.
look, i don't exactly remember it, what i remember is that night lots of people died, and a few days ago they put on,
a meeting, for the president over here.
I see
he was there and people was protesting, Why?, the current President didn't do anything to remember the local victims
I think they were called Los de Richos, Chinos. That zone practically disappeared, the whole town
of from Chorrillo
yes, from Chorrillo, exactly
yes, that's were he was. That's were was the police, or part of the polce
But that you are saying it's almost the same un Venezuela with the current President. There are happening things you don't even know
which happened a long time ago, then they put it here in Venezuela and I don't know. The Other day i wrote to one of the journalist
from Univision. I said to him to sop being so shameless, to stop saying things that were not true. People always says: Oh, that president
which is crazy, what it's really happening is that the press is changing the information, so he appears to be a monster, a dict
ator, well a dictator, we have gone through four elections and for referendums, i can't be more democratic. But it is his personality, his personality is
one in a million, and people don't accept that. It's not a common man, and people don't accept it, then he is the first criticizing that
yes, that
Oh, well, I don;t know if you listened
Yes, Because like i told you, I'm not that into news, sometimes, but its uncommon
Of course, there is a website where you can watch television from all the countries, including Panama, it's called
"TV Cuatro", like TV four
TV
four
Yes, "TV cuatro"
Four it's a number four
Right
TV number four all
TV or TVforall
exactly, that's exactly where you go
with
it's dot com, yes
OK
There you can watch the programs of all channels, of all the world's channels, and then of course is Panama and Venezuela. And now i, i watch Venezuelan tv.
But specifically, i watch the government's channel there, the national channel. Because the other channels are from the opposition, so of course it's a little bit more of the same.
But i like to watch it to see what nonsense they're talking about
OK
So, I compare them and so, if I have a website open I don't turn on the television anymore. We are now stuck to the Internet watching the channels
from the whole world, you compare, this is what is happening there, ah and that also happens with the radio, we listen to public radio, radio that you feel is
they are really saying the truth or at least, you have a different point of view, I mean we don't get the whole truth but sometimes, it's not as
biased as the other one, I don't know, I can't say that what the others say is
aha
false but they do manipulate the information
yes
I don't know if you
Hello?
did you watch, I'm not sure, did you watch a movie named "Auto Fox"
No, I might have, I don't remember
It's a documentary about Fox News
mhm
and well it's about people that used to work there and they said they were forced to lie, they quit the channel and they got together and they started to complain
on a local level, local, to tell the world what's happening there, in Fox News. It's quite interesting, it's something like
"The workers from Fox that are out"
some
Something like "out" from outside
aha
and Fox of Fox News
My name is
Hello my name is Fernanda
Hello Fernanda How are you? My name is Claudia
How are you?
Where are you from? Good. How are you speaking?
from Washington
ah. Which of the two
Washington DC
ah, b
yes Washington State
ah, already and the other
and you're from, where are you from?
Yes I am here in the state of Idaho and I don't know if you know it
yes yes of course
if this truth because I see lot of that in the movies a lot of truth in my view I don't really quite agree with them
they are not ranked very well you know. Eh, for example they sometimes say it's PG and then you see it eh that movie and really
they have pornography  sometimes and later it'sPG thirteen Sometimes it's not is more calm
and does not have as many things as nudity or profanity to be true to those classifications for me it's not like that sometimes
We don't know the people that critique these movies, and we don't know the classification o, or we don't know what it was from your point of view
Yes, I don't know much about the truth of films
aha
Lets say, I don't have children or nothing like that, then almost I notice...
aha
What, what clasification.
aha
But I think that the majority of television that are, lets say, if you see during the mid-day that is when a lot of times the kids are at home.
aha
They are things that are not appropriate for the majority.
yes
I think that hm the Americans are, not like the mo- standard morals have decreased, You understand me? then
yes
Now lots of things are like normal, that, that I think it will not be.
yes, it is true because, hm and is true because hmm, one time, well I don't have cable dont have, the normal channels, the ones to see.
aha
But for example, I had one, one time cable and sometimes was,well, what you like? ten in the morning, eleven and well I like to be changing the channel.
To be, well choosing my program that I`m going to see in that ra- in that time.
mhm
And sometimes passing movies that really, uf, if a child of ten years old or nine was in the house and was looking him, it was changing also at the same time that I, I
I stop in that channel, they were things but very, already adult.
right
And then I said, I said I thought about the kids, I said, well, I am married, I have been married three year and I have a son of almost two years
Okay
Also my son is going to grow and at least this is going to continue for the worst. So
Clearly, and
imagine for a moment what type of caricatures are going, well, I remember that one time I was watching TV. Pay attention, in Mexico, I am the city of Mexico
Mhm
It was 10 at night exactly, 10 at night. Then, I turned on, well I had cable there so I turned on the cable
The channel here is 16, then I it was a caricature in English because already at night there is something in English, something in Spanish
and it was a cartoon in English. So I left it on. And, it was my mom, well, peaceful, because she was watching a channel of cartoon
Good, well, the little monkeys began to come out naked
ah
The monkeys began to do things the two little dolls. It was a cartoon, imagine. It was 10 o clock at night, my mom said
How horrible
She turned off the TV and she had to explain a little because my mom, it surprised her because I had put on a channel of cartoons a normal channel
Then, already the truth, already no already the cartoons don't survive
Yes and that could happen to whichever child that was watching TV
sometimes the cartoons yes
And you cannot be inside let's say if a kid changes you can't skip or see, you have to have faith that , let's say, at least during the day
Yes
The programming does not have any nudity or crudity or nothing like that
yes, yes it's true. But there are not really the cartoons sorry, the Japanese cartoons are are those which have more classification eh, have. In Mexico eh,
eh, sur-in Cablevision and Multivision, what would be what cable here so- oh, there in Mexico, they don't have so many restrictions. But for example, in ordinary televisions, the regular channels
yes they have more, more restrictions. Eh, not too much in the other channels. and, for example In, in tvs, for example, regular of cha- children channels
of that kind of television, any channel, the, channels, for example that is the five in cartoons
yes
for example, then arrives at ten o'clock at night, eleven and you can watch the TV and they don't transmit so unpleasant programs. Well
in Mexico District, mhm
before, in Mexico. But for example, if you are watching a cable channel you take the risk that the cartoon could be about something sometimes about some
pornographic stuff or more about nudity.
I p-yes, and pi-look, I am from Colombia and I think that in Colombia neit-
Then, oh okay
the television is  much better than here in that way.
right
because, ca-can be, let's say ten at night and the series on air never are so, you don't take the risk, do you? to be too poor like here. Here
right
moreover, here nor at- nor at ten nor at any time you are taking the risk to watch anything
yes, yes it's true fi- the other, well eh, I was with a neighbor, imagine I was with a neighbor, it was at noon, half past twelve.
Then her kid was watching eh, the a cartoon channel and then the girl thought to change to TV and em- and wa other channel that was also programmed to them, to kids.
So there was a series where it was, where it was a, a girl that lived the adventures of a girl and she was, in a hospital
and suddenly happened right there of the hospital and they showing like, like her mom was having to her little brother.
oh, yes?
Aha, but you could still see it and I got and told her to, to her mom and she said, oh, there is not problem, that is a channel of
of, of cartoons, of, of they air programs.  And, to tell you the truth I was I was, did not, they did not leave much to the imagination.  It was really like the pose of, well ehm it was an operating room where the woman was having her baby.
how horrible
They were, they are six years old.
yes.
Because they are twins, she iss, ehm, both of them are six years old.  And their mom was letting them watch that, well each, each parent lets them see what they
what they want. But honestly to m- if I don't want to explain so mch to my children at that time, well honestly I like I watch more what the,
well what they see. no? in that aspect. But, uf
yes, imagine when, let's say there are there are babysitters and things like that that you have no centro and you are not even home to see
mm aha
you don't know what they might be watching, that they go to their friends or anything like that.
yes no
I think
yes, it is of those, for real those classifications they give. And n- and n- and, of the mainly of the television.  The truth already, already n-
they already don't leave anything to the mi- to the imagination, they now show it to you.
yes
Now at any at any time of the day you see with one of those soap operas.  I don't like to watch soap operas. But, you see
how much __, mom is at home and has her small children of three, four years old, five or more or they are at home and they see, they are watching her soap opera
and always ar- they show scenes where they are the, the, a couple, they are there having sex.
Mmm
And during the day, because sopa operas are on air from six in the morning until night
of course
And they are like that, leaving nothing to imagination
Yes, I
Then, programs are now rated, ans whatching a pornogrpahic scene in TV an any time is normal, and for many
parents, it's becoming, unfortunately, normal
exactly
And I think that if parents talk to the broadcaster, and demand for a more restricted television, of this kind of scenes
I think it would be a little better. But, now, parents are fine if the children watch something like that, there is not problem
they don't care
They should teach themselves. And then, that's why I don't like the classification system. Producers don't really care about that, i think they find helpful classification, because
if a movie has a sex scene or rude language, for the buyers, well they will laugh
and sometimes, it brings attention because it's a really strong scene. Then, those things sometimes help to
producers to sell
sometimes, and
Then no, Personally I like movies like, I like Disney movies, or
child movies, I like them
Yes,yes
Even if I'm tired I love them. I have some Disney movies here and honestly i don't like movies
that are really intense, that have a lot of things like, like sex and all that because again I tell you I'm going to have more kids and at times I'm not going to be here
and at least if they are going to put on a movie, well let it be a decent movie at least. That it doesn't have so many things.
of course, of course
The way things are going soon even the ones from Disney, perhaps will have pornography, right? So
one really doesn't know how they will change
no, no, the truth is, this is going honestly too far, you turn on the television and if you, you already see a commercial
of feminine pads and they appear there and they are going to explain there how, and in a while they will put a naked woman and they will
show there how they are putting on the pad.
exactly
Because sometimes they even draw it. I don't know if you've seen commercials like that. All the same it doesn't scare you because you're already big, right? but
but if for example a boy or a girl is watching it and you say if the mom is there she can explain it to them in a good way, and if a friend is there
and they tell them, they can explain it with bad information so,
and even one gets used to it, do you understand me? let's say
then yes
like sometimes I see it and like you don't realize how much things have changed.
Good night, my name is Mariza, from Philadelphia.
Hi, hi, my name is Juan, you are Marisol.
Mariza, Mariza.
Maybe it's... Mariza, we spoke to each other a few days ago, right?
Oh, uh, maybe, yes
Maybe, I'm at San Antonio, Texas.
In San Antonio, yes.
Hey, well, today's subject is, the matter of religion, right?
Yes, it's a very complicated and polemic subject.
Well, exactly, like the need for religion is something we all have, i guess.
Right.
And, like with all needs, institutions try to
yes
Give an answer for. And it ends up being some form of control, right?
Oh, yeas, really, these days in this country. Uh, in the United States there's also a lot of, a lot of problems with religion, that gets mixed with politics and a lot of right-wing people, who are the ones that want to control.
They try to control the country through religion and, it may seem positive or negative for a lot of people, because it helps to pray and/or believing in something, for some it helps, and for others...
In another way, the, um, the Christians are the most powerful religion in the world and they're the ones who, lets say they're the ones who have the most power to influence the politicians, the countries.
Yeah, you know, in this case, for example, over here, where i live, i once went to a Church.
Right
That, well, they represented a whole project of, ideology, but they really, they're one of the most conservative groups there are in the United States, right?
Uh, yeah.
So, they had a power very, well, very direct, very clear, trying to influence people there at the church.
Yes.
At the sermon, what specially caught my attention, against the public schools.
Um.
directly against public school, and they prayed that god will rid us from public school some day.
¿Really?
Because if
Oh, oh no.
And against the theory, that they try to teach the theory about evolution, ¿right?
Oh, yeah, I've heard that, yes.
No, terrible, they said ¿why are they harassing teachers that teach the bible to explain how the world was created?
Exactly, yes, there are a lot of trouble, yes.
Well, I'll be damned, well i said that, actually no, the bible doesn't explain the world
No, everyone can believe in what you want, the thing is that they try to impose their beliefs on everybody and the bible, what they think.
Right, they're fundamentalists, right?
Yeah, the right-wing fundamentalists, yeah, yeah. But also, the country is, uh, the party in power is, that everyone, from the president to the, everyone in it is, on the white house they're all right-wing conservatives.
White uh, christians, and they're all the people with power on the country, the ones with the companies, everyone, they're the same, they're a lot of fundamentalist and right-wing conservative people that want to remove the law.
The right to abortion, the right to, for example, like the other question, to homosexuality, gay marriages, the right to believe
yeah, more scientific right?, no, you don't have to believe only in what they say, they say god created man and woman, but also to give children a choice to believe
What was Charles Darwin theory of evolution. And
yes
And is very complicated also, of, the other question was over the homosexuality, yes, yes, yes we all were the same or believe the same, it wont be problems like this, he question.
but
so, I  believe that maybe, between more similar we are, more problems, no.
yes
On that sense, the difference help to compliment.
Of course to me, I don't have any....
The talk, the talk about homosexuality is very controvercial.
mhm
But in one specific moment, is not a, oh lets go, like tolerancy of phenomenon of the homosexuality should be something, that,that in which need to be very well informed, no, I personally for example was not thinking that....
would mean about a deviation, the homosexuallity, but ultimatley I read that there is a issue, one genetic charge.
Yes I`m,convinced of that is because I know a lot of people that are...
No
hm,so homosexuals, or lesbians and, I`m very informed and then for that, always I don't know why. From what I`m, from when I was a girl so.....
Like I accepted people for, I did not believe that they were better or worse by being homosexual and each of them have a right to, I don't know, to marry to....
so yes.
To be with whoever, equal the same if is man or woman, I do care, I don't care and I believe they have the same rights because they are equal citizens and they pay taxes also.
yes
They should have the right to marry, to live with anybody.
yes yes I am in agreement with you, exactly I believe that, all have rights, well we may have any other kind of persons, and in this case the right regarding marriage
well many talk about the issue of homosexuality as something well very pervert, and they deny the right to get married, when in reality marriage is a contract
mhm
between two persons who decided to do something in common
Sure, but the fa- the curch does not look like that
No
it believe it is an abomination because they define marriage as the union between a man and o woman and they believe, and they, and the people and the devoted Christians, fundementalists as I used to say before see that as an abomination, and they are very closed that they do not understand that
that was before, the traditional way of thinking before, but now times are changing and everyone is well, the same as before, homosexuality has always existed, from the beginning of manhood, the thing is that before there was one way and now well
it goes, thing are becoming more liberal, let's say people are not afraid of saying, well I am homosexual, or I am gay, or whatever they are
that is the problem, the church has a problem, but they cannot do anything because
aha
People are acceting the fact that other people, well look he is homosexual, and he does not care, very good
Right, yes well there is one very extreme that, the family and the marriage, the clerical institution and the blessing from God for the marriage and things when in reality
well the church and religion are an institution, same as schools, they have
sure
first the need to change and find new, new ways to learn thing of life
yes
of society and of the individuals, no
yes the re, the religion should be something personal, not something to mix with politics, each one can, the, what each thinks, the believes belong to each one, it does not have why to be
eh, well look because you don't think the same as me, you are not like me, well, that is how they punish them because they are not similar, and it is not that, everyone can think whatever they want, believe in whoever they want, or whatever they want, don't have
For the Christians, because they speak poorly of Muslims because they say that they are radicals, or they speak poorly of the, of the atheists because they do not believe in God and they call them heretics, or
But I don't know,
Aha
It's not very Christian to be that way, you have to accept people as they are, and everyone has their beliefs, or has their religion, but that is the problem of the fundamentalists, that they do not accept differences.
Well yes, but in this case, accepting differences seems to be related to humanity, eh?
mm
Like it's a paradox not to be able to accept that they think differently, but, aha
What happens is this: it's that in this country that when children are in, those types of families, the Christian families that, are right-wing, let's say that those children are raised in a way that, that starting from birth they are taught that they need to be like this, and this, and this, therefore,
When they are older and meet people that are different then they say "it's not like that, because they taught me that this, and this, and this, and you have to be..."
you know they are very, radical, no they do not accept differences because they were raised by their parents, so.
yes.
For example, I was lucky to travel a lot and meet people from many races, from many cultures, therefore I am, well, open to everything.
Aha.
And that is why when I see a person who is not, I immediately recognize it, just with one glance I say, this person is not going to accept me because I am not like her, I am not, I do not think the same, I do not look the same.
But it is that there are classes, there are people from many classes and, and you have radical Christians there has to be of all kinds, but I believe it is true, and that it strongly influences the country, religion, yes
Eh, yes, a big influence, what astonishes me is that in this case,
yes
In this country, to be so fundamentalist, no
Yes I know
With the churches, there is a large percentage of fundamentalists, even in the speeches of the president there are a few fundamentalist thoughts,
Sure yes,yes,yes
not there.
the message is very clear it has been five years since goverment, and Bill Clinton has been in Government well he was not as he was more open of course he was left more open another person.
he understood things and persons.this Government can we say its run by the that he, the religious the Christians from right or is what they are.
Saying how things are done in the country and that is why there is so much controversy, with marriage there are also with the supreme court with,with the judges that want to be right also and that they are religious well, yes
be or catholics or whatever they also want that. they take abortion rights and things then so it is it is ridiculus at this point in century.
yeah
What how, they want things to go back, to back up instead of moving forward they want things to be the way they were thirty or forty years ago and that can not be.
But this is why we are now.
yeah and you have? do you practice a particular religion?
Me in my family we are.In Spain I'am ca-catholism lets say soon as you are born they baptize you.first communion and all that, well got married in church.
sure
i believe well, i have my believe's, but i do not go to church, to service every Sunday and do not practice , you know practice, i am , i believe
but lets say i have it in my account,lets say that the fela goes with me, i know
yes
or,or I'm not, i am very opened i mean i am a believer at catholic but im not don't know i am not funda nothing
the same thing happens to me and when i have closeness to chatholic church it is only temporary, because when you have the feeling of integracion from community, here is
created intrests show all
yes,yes,yes theirs a lot of economic intrest
no, then
that's the problem,you can tell their not interested in the church goers they are intrested in the money
yes
i also do not see them beign believers there has been many cases of infant abuse and children abuse
that you hear in one questions, how can this be possible that one priest can do this to a child,there is a lot of problem with thid
yes
let say faith is each one, don't know each one is free to believe what we want and practice but lets respect other that arnt the same
yeah
there are lots of religions and what happens is christian religion is the most abundant in the world,is the most takes all power.
well in the world that we are in, this side of the world no.because I believe it is not the most Christians I think there are more muslins then christians.
Yes but they do not have economic power that is the problem
mhm
Hi, good evening.
yes, good evening.
Good evening. My name is Carolina.
Ah, how are you Carolina? You are speaking with Alex
What's up Alex?
from Los Angeles.
Ah, very good, I am, I'm from New York.
Oh, okay, I thought that that, that you were someone else. Are you well?
Uh huh.
I'm here from Los Angeles.
Ah, well very well, pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.
Well, it's our turn tonight, the technical devices.
Where are you from?
I'm from Peru.
Oh, okay.
And you?
Eh, I'm from the Colombian residence.
Columbian?
Mhm.
Oh, but you talk as a Mexican.
Because here people speak Mexican Spanish
Aha
That's why.
Ah, yeah, sure.
One gets, one gets the accent from where you live.
Oh.
With the, when I was living in Spain, I had the a-, the Spanish accent
Mhm.
when I was living in Colombia, I had the Colombian Spanish. From Bogota, specifically.
Mm. Mhm.
Now it's the turn of Mexican Spanish.
Ah, that's good.
That is what is spoken here.
Aha, yes.
Oh, ah, oh, I think that Hispanics here are about ninety five per cent Mexican.
Yeah, sure, aha
yes.
Yes, so the topic tonight are technical gadgets
yes, ah I use, use computers
Ya.
and  ah, I have the -D-S-L quickly now
Mhm
yes I love it because of the quick internet, I don't like to wait for the pages.
Ya, uh huh
so for me it's very usefull because I look for work, I make find search women
Mhm
many many things, and and I don't like to wait for the pages, you understand?
Mhm, Ya aha
I like to do it quick, and and before when I was when I had the line over telephone
yes.
it was too slow
Too slow, yes.
And so had I had to wait two or three minutes only for a page to appear
Yah, ofcourse.
And up until now, well had webcam and an the webcame was quick with the -D -S -L
Yeah, sure
The webcam is when they can see you ah, over tele- co- video conference
Mm. Mhm.
it's quick.
Mm, yes, of course.
And you?
Well, for me, too, of course and I work, my jo-, I am an administrator and so eh, my job for me the computer, so
The most essential, and mainly in the new techniques, right? the new technology that has arrived and every day new things come out, right?
yes.
So, the truth is I have adapted very well and have been fascinated since I have been using the computer, well before they used this writing machine, that was so slow to
write documents and forms, and all, now everything is done in the computer and the internet, right? it's something fascinating.
for me, it's essential
moving day after day, right
mm, of course, I think that they have, they have made more advances in computing than they have done with medicine.
You're right.
The computer  is the greatest advancement in civilization right now.
right, yes and for everything, right? that is it's everything that one
yes
wants he finds it there and so when one sits well, I use it for work, but also when I'm home and when I need
some information, but I sit down in the computer and there is not one to stop me, I don't know, it's like something, something essential and part of ones lifestyle, right?
yes, exactly.
For everything, because if you need to know how the temperature is outside, well you go to the computer.
News, sports.
It was like that before, mhm.
Ah, going out with women, everything
yes yes yes
No, and even this survey we're filling right now, I found it through the computer too
Oh, that too, yes, oh
yes, hmm, then the computer has a lot of influence
yes, right. And how many calls have you made already?
in our lives. 22, this is sh- eh, 22 calls
Oh, and, then you're already finishing up
Almost, I still have to make 3, but in one call the person spoke more in English, then I, I think I'll have to replace him
Oh, yes yes
But, but, who knows?
Yes, yes
Because I spoke in Spanish, then I think they'll accept it
Hmm, yes
Because if you speak in English, no, they won't accept it
But, the payment is made after you finish the 25 calls, right?
if you make a, a call to replace another
yes, oh, yes, yeah
I spoke to him, I know this thing's owner
Oh, yes?
Yes, i will ask if i have to replace him.
Oh, Do you know the owner?
Yes
Oh, very good
Yes, it is very easy to talk with him.
Oh, is he from California?
No, he must be from Philadelphia.
Oh, ok, ok, OK
But, he gave me the telephone
Oh, but you know him personally?
No, no, no, no
Ah, just through the computer
yes, i know him through the computer, but he
through the internet, OK
but he take part of the conversation with other people
Oh, really?, i never talk with him.
Ok, then you can ask anything. He's chinese.
Oh, yes?
Yes, well, he is the owner.
Oh
the, the manager
yes.
yes, that, for, the supervisor, of the project that he is doing
yeah, yeah, yeah,
yes, and is, that they are studying how we speak Spanish
yeah, of course, and
I don't know, is, did you know
yes,yes, I knew, besides, yes, i think they will start another one after this one is finished
No. I did not know, but is possible that yes, because, I have, I have done two
Mhm
One in English and another one in Spanish
oh, this is your second one, yes?
yes, and this one that  we are doing now is technology.
oh, oh
because it's doing connections via the telephone
yeah, yeah, oh, and the other one was the same, twenty-five calls?
and that is technology. Yes. Something like that, it was the same thing, but it was in English
yea, and you got paid also, the same?
and paid the same.
oh yeah, yeah,
Yes, I like to do this not just for the pay, but because I get the opportunity
Ah, that's good.
To speak Spanish
Of course.
because this is the only time in the day that I get to speak Spanish.
Mmm yeah.
Me, I speak just a little bit of Spanish now, I speak English mostly throughout the day.
Oh, yeah, I see.
Yes.
Yeah.
And what kind of technology do you use? What we are doing now is technology.
Well, of course yes.
What we are doing now couldn't have been done twenty or thirty years a go.
Exactly.
Because they are using multiple lines at the same time to connect people that live in different parts of the country.
Exactly.
I think that the phone technology has help in the way that I can make long distance calls and I don't have to pay anything cause you pay
ah, yeah a monthly cost
yes.
and you can make all the phone calls that you'd like.
Oh, but here in
And that wasn't-, that wasn't what it was like five, ten, twenty years ago
sure, but here in the United States
Here in the United States, yes.
Oh, yep, sure, yes, yes just as I was about to receive a ah, from Verizon that they were offering free calls here in the United States
yes.
and they gave it to and meanwhile they charged me.
if they charge you something every month, but you make a lot of calls, it's wort it.
yes. Sure.
And you know what? Some day they are also going to make international to you favorite country.
Ah, how good that was.
You pay a monthly rate, and you can make all the calls you ant.
Yeah, okay.
Yes.
How good would that be, right? yeah, that would be excellent for calling to the country whenever you wanted I think that if you're going to arrive, because with one of those cards also, right? Every day
before it was really expensive. You remember how it was? To call to the country
And now it's cheaper, right?
Right now it's incredibly cheap, sure.
And why is it so cheap? Because of the technology.
That, sure, yes, well yes.
yes, technology.
Now you can talk for three, four or five hours for five dollars.
Exactly.
Before it was a minute, oh my God it was like eight
A minute was twenty cents, yes.
And yes, I remember that I had to talk, I believe it was only ten minutes, and it cost me about twenty five dollars
Mm.
and I had to be very careful and have the clock right in front of me, no?
yes, yes, yes, I that has happened to me too
yes, aha
that yes, yes, yes, ah, I know that, what it is, you must have the clock
Aha, sure, ah, yes.
yes, but eh, with, with
yes, I've had, the truth is that, I hope that technology keeps advancing, I would say that in ten years time, what else will they come up with, no?
Because all that must keep on advancing, no?
What happens is that it's advancing and and technology is already in the hands of, of more people
Mhm. Mhm.
then services are cheaper, because they sell to more people
Na- sure, yes
do you get me?
mhmm
for example, the computer, the computer five years ago was worth two or three thousand dollars
exactly, yeah
today you can buy a computer for two or three hundred dollars
oh, yeah, that's true.
since there's more demand
Now sure, sure, yes.
Since technology was and is advancing
Oh, yeah, that's true
what I would like to see
yeah
more advanced technology is with medicine
hmmm
they have to find cures for like cancer, if you can go to the moon, why can't they find a cure for cancer? I'm sure they can, if they can make
that's true
a super fast computer that can think, why can't they find a cure for cancer?
hmmm
I want to sice more advancement in deseases, I think they're going too slow in that matter.
hmmm, yeah
I haven't seen much advancement in diseases in the last ten, twenty, thirty, forty years.
Uh um.
Well-
It's  true, because how long has cancer been around?
yes, and how many people it kills, ¿right?
and they can't find a cure for it, ¿right?, and they cand find it, ¿right?
¿Right?, and that shortens life for a lot of people.
Uh, yes, yes, yes.
Or, or the heart illness too.
Uh um. AIDS, it's now spreading everywhere
AIDS is more advanced that cancer in, in,
Well, that's true.
in the way of being controlled, because now they have drugs to control it.
Yes, yes.
But cancer is going very slow, i think.
Uh um, ok.
¿Have you heard about a discovery of cancer?
No, no, no, no, it's true.
I haven't, nothing.
Right.
Very slow.
yes.
They could improve on that.
Sure. Of course.
yes.
I wish, no? I wish that something comes out, that that God enlightens us, so that when they find something that can eh, heal, for this catastrophe that is when cancer comes, it doesn't matter at what age, but it comes, no?
yes, yes.
That shows up in any person.
I, I had a friend that died young, she was thirty two years old and she got cancer from one day to the next
yes, aha
and she died in three days.
Oh my God, in three days? Oh.
Yes, because she had a brain hemorrhage
Oh my God.
And, and she died immediately, she had luki- leukemia, of, of the blood
Oh, yeah.
and that, she got that from one day to the next.
Oh my god.
Mhm. And there was nothing that could be done, no.
Mm.
I haven't, no, eh a-
