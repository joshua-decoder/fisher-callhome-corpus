Hello
Hello, good night. Who's this?
How are you?, eh, I am Guillermo, How are you?
Ah Guillermo.
Yes.
Ah, I am Jose.
How are you, where you from?
Ah, pe- I live here in Philadelphia.
In Philadelphia.
yes, yes, and you?
Me, I am Peruvian. Uhm, I am studying in the University of Pennsylvania.
Ah, what do you study?
eh, I study History.
Ah I am an student here too, I am ah, senior
Of what university?
of, University of Pennsylvania too.
Ah yes
yes yes, I am soon finished here.
Ah how great.
But but what
And what are you studying?
Well, I'm in Wharton
Mm
So, business yes and, but then your are studying for PhD, is Master's that is exactly
Is, no, undergraduate
Oh, is undergraduate oh okay,okay.
Mm mm Mm mm, mm mm
Oh, but you are here now
Pardon?
but you live in Peru then?
me, Sorry what did you say?
Do you live in Peru?
I mean, I lived in Peru, til three months ago
Oh.
Of course,
So you are a freshman or
no, what happens is that I studied two years in the university of Peru, and then I transferred here, in other words, I'm an international transfer
Oh Oh, okay. So you are not an exchange student, you are a transfer?
Of course is, eh, eh, in other words I'm going to graduate with a title from this university.
Ah Ah that's good.
A difference a, an exchange student for example right.
Ah that's good. And you think so far?
Hey, this a little hard truth
yes, but English is, or is
And, well, English, English is in fact one, say
However, all the work.
it's difficult to study many parts of English, but I have the time, I know some of the difficult English expressions
yes yes
No, that is, that's uh, very clear to me
yes
Eh, but otherwise, if, in the amount of work to me, I'm told, is also a
More than in Peru?
I do, I think if you send more
Mm
more than in Peru. Even last season, Peru this I, at my university take six courses. eh, one semester
Hm mm
And, and, even so, I think I had less work than what I'm having now, taking five courses.
Mm
But hey, what happens is that I'm giving five courses, but also work.
oh okay okay
i don't know, sometimes its equivalent to take six subjects something like that
yes yes
its sometimes a little less,i don't think its so so, demanding like taking six subjects, but
yes, its still a lot
i think so, yes yes, i don't know, maybe in the future they will
yes its hard,
i, i , i would like to take less subjects, i don't know, how many subjects do you take?
um it depends, in general, five, sometimes, its just that sometimes, the past cycle, i only took four, but I'm not taking five.
yeah, and and you
but in general, in college people only take four.
yeah
i think, yeah, but in wharton, in general people take five.
i understand, and you work as well,
uh
or do you study full time?
yeah i have too, i mean i have a small job at the library, i work study but its like, there, i don't work when i dont go.
i study, so its not really like that.
oh, it seems so good, that, you do it in your own workplace, in the library, but I'm a shelver.
mm
Hence, really I don't get the opportunity to study.
Ah, I would do that sometimes but, where are you, in which part of the library? In
In the fifth floor of Van Pelt
Mm, okay okay
You, where do you work?
In Lippincott
Where is that?
Is, it's in the Wharton library.
OK
yes, it's in the second floor mm, but, yeah, it's there, it's a good job because I only work, and I don't work a lot five hours a week, sometimes I work ten hours a wee, but
It is always like that, I do my homework, right so it's not much, there are times, for the final, there is some more work, because
there are more people who need help, and the whole world.
Hm mm
He is doing his investigations but in general, it's a lot right, I don't have much work.
Hmm mm
But if here it's eh, but what I have seen is for example, sometimes, in Latin america, but you see that in Europe
In the universities, they give you during, well in general, there isn't much job until the final, right, so the professors
Ah, in England, for example?
eh, yeah, in Europe in general right.
yes, I've also heard, that, the quantity of for instance, of the numbers of hours that take during the week.
Hmmm
They're, I think they're less than three
Hmmm
Then you have a lot of spare time. I mean, you don't have a lot of classes
yes yes yes
And besides that, I think, I mean, they don't give you a lot of homework, no, I'm not sure
yes, well, well, they, they don't give you a lot of homework, but eh, generally they want you to, well, you to
you to be reading everything, to be solving exercises, and to keep doing all that, right
Sure, hmmm hmmm
Understanding everything, right. And then in the end they give you a test and that's your grade. But here in America it's
different, right. Because here in history, you have to research, and then an essay, then something else, and another, and a test
hmmm
it's better in the sense that you, okay, there are less risks, but
yes, yes, that definitely is an advantage, right, there are less risks
the work, yes, yes, but
Because, imagine that for example, your whole grade was to be decided by a test. Maybe the night before you couldn't sleep well
anything could have happened and then
yes
you don't perform well in the test, you might have studied a lot, but for any reason you didn't do well in the test, then
yes
I mean, let's say that the grade
yes
it lowers your grade, I don't know, I mean
yes, but also all the work they gave us, you know, each week you have one think and other
other work, then
yes, yes
Each one, each system has its cons and pros. But, and in Peru?, how is it, in general?
Well, I would say that they make us work, we don't have the equivalent, midterms
Hmmm
But they are at most, reading controls
Mmm
Spread, l mean, spread all along the semester
Mmm
And for some courses, they ask, at the end of the course, to present and essay. An investigation paper
Mmm
And besides that, you also have a final exam. But, let's say you don't have to make as much as you do here
Mmm
So, you don't have to write that much
Mmmm
Here, they keep you constantly writing, papers, and reviews, right?
YES
there not a lot, o be there more well what I had to write for example i wrote in an exam, or to deleiver an investigation.
Hm mm
at the end of the semester, but out of that, no no no have to produce a lot
yes yes
And well or this could be seen like ahead in the sense that you don't have they don't they don't they don't ask you for much. or be
one can live a little more relaxed.
yes yes
but to the point, the disadvantage is you do not get, you manage to practice you,you you,you no,no you are on a constant practice from the labor this
from investigation, and also of of how to describe not real, or is at times one for not writing as much so a little loses easiness,not true to write.then
Hm mm,hm mm
That is why I said or is more is more easy or is
yes Hm mm,mm
Is more easy,but I do not know if is lets say yes,if it form you as well that they form you.
yes yes
But it has costs that you form-or sea the the cost is that a-aca they better form is fine but at least i for example this weekend I'am full of things to do so
you live a little more, well at least,I lived a little more anxious, let's say a little more
yes
stressed
yes yes
But I don't know how it's gonna be in Wharton
If Wharton is also different because also depends. It depends because, for example, classes that I have in general, don't have ...
so testing or research, generally only have two or three tests. But there are classes, for example, that have more, one has the two tests, but also has projects
Yes.
Like case studies type
And there are personal items or in groups?
In groups, in general, in those days almost everything is in groups. And of course, they give you tasks and stuff, because otherwise
because, y like it that way, for example, each week have a little job to do, that you have to present, because in that way ...
you have an obligation to study
Of course
But yes, I like this, sometimes they do that, but in general, there are exams or projects. But in ...
Hm mm
each class there is always an exam, I've never had a class with only projects. Usually two exams and maybe one project.
Hm mm, hm mm
Now in Marketing class, we have a project that is like ..., and I do not know how they did ...
they created a whole software that is like a simulator, and then, for example, every order, there are five or six orders, then
one have a group
Hm mm
and then everybody, to each group they assign a company
Hm mm
So, one has various products, this company has various products, so one has to decide for every base for each product, cause when we go, what type of
How are we going to sell this product, we are going
Ah, that's interesting
Put more, yeah yeah yeah, like one, but of course its nothing like real life, but
but, you mean, it at least works on something,
it helps, yes yes, its not interesting but, when its done, you have to write various reports, you have to make an analysis.
of what one did, the errors, from what someone did it correctly.
hmm mm
so, there are various things like that, so everything, depends about the course, but
hm mm
um,yeah, here yea, there is and i, never write anything in general, so it seemed a bit weird that i had to write.
yeah
but um, what else, and now, I'm sure you don't like it right.
what?
Its really cold here right?
Well, yeah,yeah,yeah it was raining on tuesday.
Yeah
I froze, yeah, i mean i have to go with my huge jacket, i mean i have-, i bought a jacket that helps a lot.
nah, yeah
And i have, i mean, i always go out with it, but sometimes, maybe, while wearing the jacket, i get cold, but oh well, inside my room its well, um,
hm
its manageable the issue, inside the dorm, the temperature is enough.
pe-
Its warm right?
but in peru, they told me there are regions were its very very cold, right?
well of course, if you go to the mountains.
hmm mm
also at night, in conclusion, even if you go to the mountains during winter, winter nights are very cold, yeah
hmm, i see,
i would say that even, um i remember once, i went to the mountains of peru, and um it was like vacations with my family, and yeah, at night,
it could even get colder, to what I've experienced here.
hello?
Hello, my name is Gloria.
Hello, Gloria.  I am Paulina.  Where do you call from?
Oh- From New York.
New York.  I am in Georgia.
From Long Island.
Ah?
From Long Island
Long Island
Aha.
I am in Athens, Georgia
Oh, from Georgia, oh, my god
Mm.  How is-?
I didn't understand what she said.
How?
Something about religion.  She said to talk
You didn't understand what she said.
No.
She was talking about religion, what is the opinion on religion, if it unifies people, or if it keeps them apart, if all should belong to the same religion, or, what do I know?
Of- Ah, OK. Am, I am Catholic.  So, I believe, in my opinion, am, they separate people.  For example, I have a nephew who is gay,
then, they in the Catholic religion, they do not accept gays,
Aha.
because God didn't make them like that.  But, if I remember when I, my nephew was born, at one year, we knew that he, that he, that he was going to do it.
People don't believe they are born like that, but he was born like that.  And, only, if you have someone in your family, then you know.  Then, he
has lots of problems with the Catholic religion because they don't accept them, and he knows that they don't accept them.  But, in the end he found a church, on thirty-second, in New York, which accepts homosexuals.
OK.  Well.  I think that, regarding religion, that if people followed their religion, there wouldn't be so many problems like when they go to the extremes, be it any religion.
Mmh.  Aha.
If people followed, for example, the ones who follow Jesus Christ, if they followed the teaching of Jesus Christ, and if they acted as Jesus Christ acted,
Mmh.
There wouldn't be so many problems.
Aha.
But when they start to fight, that's not what was taught
Mmh.
Jesus Christ.
Exactly.
where there are problems.
Mmh.
Same with Muslims,
Mmh
or Jews, the principles of, of these religions and what they teach,
Mmm
Yes, those are good things, but when people gets really fanatic, they don't accept other people, we respect differences
I see, I see
I think that that's when division starts,  problems
Yes, like this one, What should I have said?, Me, at  night, me to the girls where I work, three
I bring a book from Joyce Myers, everyday scriptures, I read it to them and then they said it it's rubbish, and I said, but
listed what she is saying, listen and learn to treat nice your neighbor, like you'll want to be treated, Oh, but I don't have to treat her nice
I don't like her. I say to her that we all are created like God. And we start the fight. Then I say, Look, I want peace, why do all this happens?, why don't we talk about
about the day's topic. But forget that, it has become a, they still look for me. For reading, everyday
nice
Because, it's like a rocket. I was saying that I don't want to be with her, because she takes away
all my energy. She is always criticizing everyone and I don't want to be in that environment. She says, if a read all days, the other ones is saying
right five things about why you are thankful to God. She is always reading about religion,.
I think that this has saved my mind, because, if not, i start to criticize that everyone criticize me, and I know that I'm a  God person, and God loves me as I am
If I let myself go with people say, I would have jumped from a window
yes
And that's what is happening to her, she is being criticized, I told her, Look, God loves you, as you are. But you can't keep criticizing everyone
And, it's true, it's the same when
yes
in relation with everything, like religion, as a people. Look whats happening in Israel, between
yeah
between the Palestinians and the
yes, yeah
and the Jews
Yeah
It's sad, they fight all the time
yes, yes, yes, yes
because they both have sacred places, but they don't respect
yeah, yeah
other people
It's that, the, uh, precisely the catholic religion, everyone is leaving, like my, my friend who went to another church. She tells me
this, that, and this and that, and I tell her, you have to find the church you want, the one you believe, that, that completes you
Or that, I won't tell you go to the catholic church, if it's giving you nothing, just because I go to catholic church
So, then, she, she found another church, she tells me, maybe you should go with me, i tell her no, leave me be, I'm very happy where I am
and you know, I go to charismatic groups, so, I, I, I like to go to other churches, I'm not saying I don't, but I don't want her to
I have gone to that church already, a long time ago. And, and it takes the whole Sunday and I don't have all day on Sundays to be there
three or four hours
Ah, yes
Yeah
what religion is she, your friend?
Ah, eh, I think it's Christian Science, something like that
Oh
yes, yes, yes. They're like born again Christians, something like that
I see
Something like that. So, you know, I, she was catholic. But her husband goes to, to the catholic church. I, in my house, I'm the only one who goes to church. My son doesn't like to go, I'm always arguing with him so he'll go
And, he doesn't think God is helping him, so I tell him, I tell him every day, God gave you that, like today, we were talking about
Katrina, and he says, ouch, God did that
hmmm
And I couldn't convince him it wasn't God, that was an act, you know, an act of God, as they say, but it wasn't
God himself, he doesn't, although the Bible said things like that were going to happen. So, I was telling him, maybe read the Bible, it teaches what
hmmm, yes
hmmm
That's right, I find that, about religion, many people go only in the name of tradition
yes, yes
when you go and seek for the, the truth
yes
And you really seek, then you find a religion that
yeah, yeah
you like. But many people go only, only for tradition, but they don't know what their own religion is about
Exactly, they sit there and when the priest stops, they leave, they run
yes, or don't study the scriptures by themselves, or anything.
yes
yes.  It Helps when one starts to study, that what one believes in, is their own religion
It is- yes, yes.  Like lately, I am going to a charismatic group. So, I am understanding more, even though they say it in Spanish, and I don't understand, I can speak Spanish, but I can not read it nor write it.
So then, they gave me a Hispanic bible as a gift, and I, forget it, I am reading it, but I don't know.  Then, I go and explain it to them, I red this, and this, and this,
that is what, then, they read it in English to see if I can understand it.  But, it becomes very difficult, the bible is, is
The Bible, yes, the Bible is difficult.  The vocabulary it uses, anyway, it doesn't matter what language, I find
E-exactly, exactly.  So, I find it very difficult, so, I, they give me some, some passages, and then I read it, and then, they tell me, this is this, and this, and this
You know, and, and they start to use it like in our lives.  And, I say, oh, okay.  Then, I understand
Hmm Where are you from?
I am Puerto Rican.
Puerto Rican. But you grew up in the United States?
yes, yes, yes, yes.  I was born in Puerto Rico but I grew up in New York, what they call el barrio.  In East what they call the barrio, in Manhattan
Ok, I don't know
yes, You _, You have always been from Georgia?
No. I am from Chile.
Oh, from Chile, oh, okay
yes.  I grew up, and was raised in Chile, and when I finished middle school of High School, I came to study to the university, to
But I saw- Aha
United States, here
Ah.
And we have been here in Georgia, my husband and I, two years, but I've been in the United States for eleven years.
Wow, wow, wow, wow.
I lived in Wyoming for a few months, I lived in, in Utah
Wow.
for several years. And a year and a half in Maryland.
Aha, aha.
In Washington DC
Aha.
And now we're in Georgia.
Wow, you travel a lot.
dog, like they say.
Aha. That's good, that's good, to move like that. You see, I live,
Aha yes
I lived in Manhattan, then I lived in the Bronx, and now I moved to Long Island and we stayed here. Even though, when we retire, we're going to live I guess
in Florida. Because my boy, my oldest boy and my grandchildren live in Florida.
Ah, then you are going to
So I would like to go, I would like to go to Florida to be close to them. But by the time I go, already my grandson, maybe he has already gotten married.
Because he's already seventeen years old, by the time I retire it's ten more years, he'll be twenty seven. Maybe he's going to get married.
Maybe in another place, yes.
i am going to be, right.
Oh, yes, we, who knows where we're going from here, because
Yes
Let's see, we're going, my husband is finishing his PhD
Right
In two more years. And from there, wherever there's work
Oh, where there's work. ¿And what do you work in there?
Yeah. I'm at home, with my kids.
Oh, oh, you're at home with your children, oh, that's good.
Um, i have two, two babies. One is one year old, and the other is three.
Oh my god, yes, yes. That's a lot of work, ¿right?, i do, i do children parties. I dress like a clown and now I'm trying to imagine how can i make Elmo's head
Because i have the, the bodysuit, but
Oh, yes
The head is my friends. So, her and i did a party. So, sometimes they ask for two and we couldn't go, only one can go.
Oh
So, I'm trying there, my friend is making me one, but the head is very heavy. So, i can't even imagine how we're going to make that head.
So, and, and through that, because i wasn't listening to what the lady was telling me, because a tape of, and i say, oh, I'm doing a lot of things, i have to focuse
All at the same time, yes
All at the same time, because sometimes they call, and they don't call, and sometimes i pick it up, and i don't pick it up. And there were, they gave me this discussion last week and i don't know why the argue about the same thing.
¿Oh, right?
You know, you have done that a long time, that?
Am, have, have done, think that ten once
Oh, like me yes. Something like that yes
yes, not so much
Oh, okay, yes.
But the last time, was the, what I did, was of politics. No, no I don't remember of what it was

How long? How long have you been in the United States?
Five years already
Five years and do you already speak English and everything?
yes, yes I do. I find it easier.
Did you get your citizenship or not yet?
Is the residency. But because I have one more, four years married
uh, uh
then
But after three years of marriage you can apply for the citizenship
yes, but what happens is that I have dual citizenship, I am a Venezuelan citizen and Italian citizenship.
Because my father is Italian.
Oh, Oh, do you speak Italian?
yes, and then
Now
I believe that if I accept American citizenship they will force me
to renounce right now.
Exactly. Citizenship and that are not acceptable
Mmmm. The two other... other citizenship are but... you have found out something about that because, for example, in Chile we now dual citizenship. One may be a United States citizen.
Yes, but what happens is that as I have two, they don't let you have three.
You're right
You see?
This is a little difficult.
Yes.
Ah, they are, right? Are you happy with residency. Your parents are.
You see?
They live in Italy or in Venezuela or they come here
No, my mother, my parents live in Venezuela but my father was indeed from Italy. He was born in Italy.
Okay. And your grandparents? Your aunts and uncles? Are they in Italy?
No. Uh on my father's side, yes.
Okay in Italy I have some friends that live in Roma.

It's beautiful. I have seen photos of that, that place. And I have seen beautiful... BEAUTIFUL countrysides from there.
Uh huh
Beautiful, Do you have animals?, cats?, dogs?, something like that?

And aquarium. I walked my dog out
The issue is because we want to have a puppy

Being able to move.

So that it is in and doesn't feel yes, we don't go out just a month ago. Ah, for me the house that we're now talking about.
And we had to close the yard and put some cardboard to keep the puppy out because the dog wasn't so small, it's a retriever.
Exactly.
So, it comes in and out of the garage but the door is open and it is in space where it can walk and run and play.
yes, I want to, yes, that it can go out and in, that it can play in the yard and that. Not like that.
And it has
Runs over there, it does exercise.

yes
a lot more, a lot more, is what I have look over the internet
Exactly
I need music for me, i mean, I need music for everything, when I'm working or studying
I like to have some music, It keeps my awake. In that way, Music for me, it's really important
It's relative
Exactly
it helps me concentrate, it helps me to relax, to me music can change the way you feel, Imay be
right
very quiet and if I listen to a song that can turn me into bad mood or cheer me up
right, right, me too, because I play my instrument, and my husband plays his and at least, maybe some festivals and so
OK
there is a bar close to my home where many people come to pley every night, people just sit there and play their instrument
and there are open circles every night and songs from, where people play and then in the weekends come here several music bands
to play every night, in the weekends and it's very cool
ok. eh, what is your favorite kind of music?
I like everything
is there some kind of music which you don't like?
To me, that I dom't like, I think rap hip hop, and pop music
so I don't like Britney Spears and so, that doesn't call my attention at all
OK
I do like, I do like Spanish rock very much, I have a lot of spanish rock and bluegrass
ok. And do you have a favorite band?
Well, I like, in Spanish rock I like Fito Paez a lot
OK
who is from Argentina
yes
yes, i like him very much
Okay
And, ah mm and i the American music, you have a guy who's name was, is very good
What
and the one who died that was too, a good singer at least around here, where i live, you have allot of people that perform
Oh.
lots of our friends that perform and sing and have groups
yes
and all the groups they have are very, very, good indeed
Okay, I am, for me, like, not very, eh mm, maybe a few, one or two concert every year but i don't know ah, in
in general the type of concert i ago is eh, like rock, in English, the kind of way that, people that go are more like the
very young and too outrageous. Kind of, that's why i don't, I'm not that attracted to going to concerts as such
Ah
Right and at least this year i did go to a concert of, ah, Willi Nelson
Aha
and Bob Dylan
yes
and you had people of all ages, like sixty seventy years old and children of eighteen years too, at the concert
yes
yes, then yes, right then. They had it on a small stadium, baseball one and you didn't, yeah, didn't had lot of people but
but yea it was really, really good, the concert.
What, uh, do you buy music or do you have a lot of CDs?
More yea, more than anything we but music but also we buy a lot of music from groups like, that that aren't very popular, that it's like that people that we know
yea.
yes, because we're members of a of, the, ah the society of folk music in Philadelphia, and so there at least there's lots of musicians
that are members and they give concerts in houses and all that, every month
Okay.
there's a concert in, in a house of one of the members and we buy all those CDs
Okay.
from groups that we see there that that who are that aren't super, super famous but that yea, they're good
Okay.
And so sometimes we've, we've seen, at least some groups that we
and
we knew we were famous and all of a sudden we're listening to it, we're at a festival or something like that
yes.
and all of a sudden we hear a song that is famous
okay.
but
The, and the uh you say that you play instruments, uh is it, does your husband play in a band, a musical group?
No, no, no. My husband used to play in a band, but that group's not together anywhere, maybe they're going to, maybe they'll get back together
Okay
But no, we don't play for any band, or sometimes my husband that plays with his friends, but what happens is that we don't have much time, like to
like, to commit with the people
Okay.
Because of work and that doesn't, and, and we don't have time, to commit with a band yes, with a band because if you have a band, you have to practice at least one day
Rehearse and look for the
week
the promotions and
OK
yes
So, yes,  you can to dedicate a lot of time, and the, at least there is a band that wants my husband to play with them
but where they meet, they meet on Wednesday nights around ten at night and the they practice until two in the morning, on Wednesdays,
because he has to work and, the school and that, doesn't have enough time
yes, ah, Ok, I, I would love to have eh eh to be able to play any instrument, but I'm terrible with that, but for me the
music, music is very, very necessary. For me eh, I , I love, I mean, I am, I can be ah
I remember the songs of, a lot of songs of
Mn
songs that I haven't listened in years and in a moment I, eh I listen to it, the song again and after years I can, sing the hole song
It happens to me, if I don't sing a song for a log time I forget it. But I, I was, the other day I was talking to a friend and
and we were with her, we listened a song on the radio that she hasn't listened for about eight years and she remembered the hole song
and they played a song that I haven't heard before, I hadn't listened to that song for four years and I know a song and
I knew the song but I didn't remember the lyrics, I remembered just a bit, not much. I don forget them, if not
if I don't listen to them often, I forget the lyrics, I know the tunes, but not they lyrics, I forget
Ah, well, for me, to me it depends on the, on which mood I am, if I go, well that
well I, eh, I have an Ipod. Do you know what an iPod is?
Aha.
Eh, to me well, eh I have like ten thousand songs, in the, in the Ipod.
Aha.
and I have all types of music there, I have a playlist with music to, to dance, dance music
I have a list of, rock music, eh, in English and that's, I basically use it when I go to the gym
Exactly
I have a playlist for, eh, Spanish music a list of classical music, opera, things like that
to relax
Ah, and to study
and, I have a list, on the contrary, for me, to study I can't have that type of music on, I can't be listening to classical music, I need music
yes?
that has lyrics because if there are none, if it doesn't have lyrics it's like it bores me I nee- I need something to distract me
What, what do you study?
Eh. Eh, with-, I work with viruses
OK
in biology
OK
so that, I always need something to distract me, that, that keep a-, attentive
Exactly.
yes, yes, if I play classical music I don't
Mm.
I, I fall asleep, I on- have m-, I only play classical music when I have many times when I have to eh, if I have to write a paper that I need to be very very very concentrated
so, then but always since I was little, when I had to study, I was always listening to music and while I was singing, I could be reading and my dad always criticized me that
it's impossible that a person could read and sing at the same time, but I don't know, it always worked for me, I always got good grades, so
I, I supposed that
I had a teacher
no
that said that when no, when you're studying something that you need to, something that you need to learn that if you sing what you need to learn, you learn it better
faster than if you read it normally
yes, that doesn't, that doesn't attract me at all, the the music, I mean, eh you can
hello, hi
hi, do you speak with Fabiola
and they connected you and that is how it worked.
right, and that's how it works and and they pay you.
oh, look also
brilliant or not.
then let's talk about the memories.
about all the best things that have happened to you in life.
ah
and how has your life changed
esta bien
And what is the best thing that has happened to you in life?
ahh so many things.
but the best you feel has happened to you in life.
ahh
that's a good subject.
if I know someone with these kids
yes.
I think that everything starts knowing someone because if I wouldn't have met him then no.
yes I say the same
these kids wouldn't be here
ah yea, the best thing that's happened to me was meeting my husband
yes because like
and the second and the other great thing that happened to me was to have my kids
yes
to be healthy to be healthy
for, yes because if not because if you hadn't met the boy you, you wouldn't be here
yea really
also I wouldn't have had these kids, I wouldn't have known you either
yes
if it weren't for him or
why? It's OK all of that about nice subjects that well you can find interesting things to talk about when you talk on here because they also play music for you yesterday the music was
yes
eh, yes and it's fun, you talk twelve minutes and then they cut off your call
hey I like them
yes they tell you you've got thirty seconds left to say goodbye
ohh
and so we have twelve minutes to talk about whatever we want because they're using it to recognize our voices
but uh what's it called you don't have to talk about what they tell you to
you have to talk about, you have to talk about what they tell you to or whatever you want to, the idea is to talk because that's all, they're recording the whole conversation
ah so that after the computer know that eh
who is who
and by the, by the accent
by the accent, the system, and the form of speaking and
mm
by the speech tone and something are already invented
yes by the
then they need people that have different voices
ah no idea, and i didn't called because i said it could be done
and the
earlier
yes, the girls, they all connect with this number
yes
and talk at the same time, and hour
ehh
and they connect and good
then, i would try to call later then or at noon best, don't know
yes but i don't know if you can make two calls at the same time
the same day
aha, i don't know that you can listen the voice of those kids, pretty
Yes I can hear, it's that you're here.
Yes, I can hear you very clearly.
They're both laughing.
Yes they are, and what are you doing to make them laugh?
They're right here, the two of then are sitting on my legs, one in front of the other, and they're looking at each other and laughing.
They're looking at each other and laughing and saying, you look like me, oh, no, you look like me.
and one of them has the pacifier tied to the bib, so he throws it at the one who's holding it, and he throws it
Kids are entertaining, and oh my how they're growing. And are you talking to them?
ah
Do you have to talk to them now, or not?
What?
are you talking to them. Are you talking to the kids?
Yes, yes I'm talking to them. I talk to them all the time and I speak to them in...
in English?
In Spanish.
Oh.
And you speak to them in English.
In English, that's good, because they're going to speak both languages and...
Yes because that way, later, they grow up with the two languages.
Yes.
just because, and also because they grow with, uh, without an accent
he, picture Geni with both languages, but he also, uh, talks to me in both languages and he can read both languages, but he has an accent and has troubles with Spanish
eh
and despite that since she was little, and has her first 3 years, she was born here
m
But when she was two and a half months old, I took her to Chile, and in Chile
and where did she learn to speak? did she learn to speak when she was in Chile? well, yes
she learned words by herself, she couldn't say full phrases because he
ahh
we came here every year on vacation, and one month here
ah
and the dad always spoke to her in English
so she was like confused
and, yes, and then he, uh, and when she listened, she heard bad Spanish from Michel
m
or bad English from myself
ah
now I speak a better english, Michel speaks a better spanish, and now she can read in both languages, and she's getting better, but they get confused when the dad
speaks with an accent, a strong accent
the bad part is, I mean, when I speak to them in spanish, but the bad part is that, for example, when I'm with someone else and they speak English
I speak to them in English I understood
But isn't that bad?
because no but it is bad because no, because my accent is not I understood
it is not good, no
and I know that they are small now they are not going to, they are not going to speak now but what oh in any case they are recording all that then
yes starting at four months old children start to
it is that
and do you have plans for Christmas or Thanksgiving?
for Thanksgiving we are going to go with my, with Armi's grandparents they come back to eat because I
OK
my mother-in-law is fixing the house
yes
so we are going to have to go to his grandparents and they together
for Christmas are you already planning the gifts and all that?
what?
the gifts, are you planning for Christmas or not?
mm no,not yet, not yet, no
not yet
and you?
so then the, the children are going to be grown up for Christmas they are going to play already.
Yes
that's gorgeous
¿and do you have plans for Christmas?
I'm thinking about buying, uh, we're buying the tree
Um
a live tree like every year, we buy it alive
Uh
Um, we'll see, i don't know, look, i bought Michel a car
¿Really?
Yeah
A real car or a car
A big remote controlled car
Oh
Uh, of about a hundred and sixty dollars, i got it on sale on fifty dollars
¿And what kind of car is it?
Uh, like James Bond's
Oh
but it's James Bond's and with a remote, I'm gonna put it as a gift from Santa Claus
¿Huh?
And for Jenny, i don't know yet, I'm looking for something, there's something she likes a lot, it's a game boy, but a new one
Mm, oh okay
that you, you don't use keys you touch the things and they start moving
yes
a super, super new one that came out
oh
so I think I'm going to get that for her that I know that's what she wants
and what did you get her for her birthday?
a karaoke machine
a karaoke machine, and she plays with that?
aha she loves it, is good, because at her age she's reading while the letters come out and get darker, changing color
mm
so then she is singing the song
oh
and it entertains her a lot I tell you that's good to read faster that's, that's super good for Christmas and for, for my father-in-law
I bought eh a gift on behalf of Jonathan
mm
that is a
for the
for the computer, it has eh to move the mouse
eh?
you move the mouse and you have a calculator
the mouse has a calculator?
no no no, the place where you move the mouse is a little square
ah that, that, that little plastic thing
and that one
ah OK
so I bought one for my father in law and one for us on behalf of Jonathan
eh?
eh and he thinks that, another good idea and I don't know why else
and will you be here for Christmas or will you go to?
no, we already bought the tickets, we're going to Arkansas we're going to Arkansas to spend eh fifteen, a week
a week
mhm, all the years we go for a week
oh, I Christina told you the other time that they were thinking of going to to Chile for work
oh yes
and from there it didn't work for them
no but still it doesn't start
but he told me that maybe no and everything that
sure but maybe, it's not true that not and it's not true that
mm
They told him that is there, they have the personal, in any case they are going to let him know
yes
is like, we call you later
something like that
but the work in Chile hasn't started yet
ahh
still there, I also was touched, I told Michel, Michel if it comes out we go
would go
Michel yes yes but
m
It's the same as what I think. I say how we going to go even with the new house we bought. How? they tell me
Eh
We'll sell it then and it makes me laugh because for him it's so easy like nothing more to get rid of it, take the stuff and get rid of them
and for me it cost me a lot of work
Because it cost you a ton to find the house
yes and after to put it together, I tell you I haven't even put up the curtains, those curtains are arriving in a bit
Yeah?
We bought them through JCPenny
Hmm
They are arriving bit by bit first there arrived some curtains, last night another part arrive, a part for the top
Yeah?
then after I got another top part and there are still stuff missing, I still need three curtains that still need to arrive that have not come yet
And they are? Are they those in the living room?
The ones in the dinning room I didn't put because how do you say, I didn't put perciana
Ahh, you didn't put perciana?
No because the the rest of the house I put percianas but not the dinning room because the windows are not windows, they are small windows
Ah
Then they don't make them that size unless you get them specially made for that
speacially for
Hello,
Hello
Who is speaking?
My name is Anny
Hello Anny, I am Arturo
Hello Arturo
fro where are you calling?
From Miami
from Miami, very good I am speaking from
from where?
Philadelphia
Philadelphia
yes, where are you from?
Eh, Puerto Rican
Ah, OK
and you?
I am Mexican
ah,
yes
Are you studying here in the United States?
yes, exactly
That's good,
do you study or work?
No, eh I have a daughter of twenty three months and I have a son that is now four days old
Oh, wow, that's nice
So, no, I'm not working but no
Yes, well, of course
Not outside the house
yes, of course, too much work at home I imagine
yes,
That's good. But very happy I imagine, no,
yes, a bit tired now but very happy
yes, the boy is four days old
Four days
wow, a very few
yes,
That's young. Listen and this, then, why do you live in the United States? have you lived there all your life or?
yes, eh, my parents are from the Dominican Republic
OK
And in nineteen sixty something, I don't know exactly when it was
mh mhm
ah, I think that was the seventy-three, I'm not sure
mhm
But a revolution in Santo Domingo
Okay
And they went to live in Puerto Rico
ah, okay
Then they spent twenty-five years there
uh huh
Then from there, my sister when she went to the University she came here to the state of Florida Then we moved to Miami
ah, okay
And I had like I think I was five years old
ah, very little
yes my sister is ten, eleven years older than me
ah, okay
Then from there we, you know, we stayed and
yes,
eh, me, I went to school here and you know We made a life here
yes, yes, of course
And
And now you are married with a Latin guy or an american?
An American
Oh, I see
yes, I met him at college
Oh, ok, it's from Miami I guess
No,I went
Ah, OK
Eh
OK
So, I met him there
Oh, I see, very well
Then
And
after taht, ah
So, in which language do you speak with your...well, at this moment they don't even talk, your children, because
Well
He has 24 moths, no..
it has 23 months and the other one 4 days
23, well, he is
And what we do is that when he is not here,when my husband is not at home
mm
i speak Spanish completely to my daughter
okay
when he is here, we completely speak English
ah, okay
and that way she will know both languages
know them
and, and me, i am surprised because many times she says things
ah, yes
that i didn't even notice that she already learned
ah, for real
can be in English or Spanish
wow yea,
she is already getting it
very fast
yes
also no, or what age do children normally start talking, i don't know really
and mm i believe that she was lets say fifteen or seventeen months
okay
like shes learning English and Spanish
right
Eh, that gives up the kids who do that that gives them a little more time to speak.
yes, yes
So my daughter caught it you know, her friends or whatever, her little friends
yes.
Eh, they would speak clearer and more than her.
yes.
ah, not long ago
ah
so now her, I knew she was, understood and she could talk.
yes, but
But since she has two languages it was harder for her
of course yes, it would be more difficult, but, well I think, well in the long-run it would be good too right, growing up with these languages is an advantage.
yes, yes
really
So eh, but, you know, her, I know she understood.
mm
What I was saying to her in English and Spanish.
Yes, yes I can imagine.
And now, you know, I know especially she understands me because when she doesn't want to do something like she plays silly and you know,
yes
And i see her face and i know she understands me, exactly
yes, right, the kids are very clever after, after, no,
yes, yes
You know
so then, you know, she understands, she speaks,
mm
and
Then yes hopefully she remains that way, because when she start growing more and lots of her friends talk in English she will practice more of it i think
yes and no, eh, we will not send her to the school, yes i will teach her at home,
ah, okay
Because i was, was a teacher
ah,
Then i think that for me to go to work and teach them you know, the children's of others, for that reason i prefer staying at home
aha
And i can teach my own children
yes, that's true
So then
but, but, what do you think about the fact she will not have school colleagues ? and such
Good
That's an experience too, no, I mean
yes, they have many here in Miami, programs, for people that, that teach their children at home
aha
So, eh, normally once a week, they they get together
ah, OK
So it's like a school, it could be that, that eh, he has a class in a church or in a University, or whatever, but it's like a school that meets once a week
ah, OK
So that, and you know too, with his friends and all that, y have many friends and families that have done that
the
mhm, and, and they don't have any problem
ah, OK
you know, but also it's not something that
yes,
Because that one to me, that worries me also, I want her to have friendships and friends and all that
yes, of course, that's what I was thinking because if, I mean it's part of the experience, no, of being at school that you meet people
yes, yes,
So I think that also, that's important, its not that, is not that you miss that when your a kid, because truly your friends are very important
yes, yes
I think, no,
yes, yes,
But if with that is having contact with other people, it should be at least one weak but
And also you know, they have the sports, the, the in the eh, I mean the places at the community
yes there are many, the thing is that here there is big support to the community, really and that
yes, you know, thinks like that makes the, how you say, they socialize
yes, I see
like that, you know
yes, yes, yes, yes I like anything in Mexico that is not common, understand me, absolutely does not happen
yes,
Then I don´t know people who comes from that kind of schools, understand me.  and always I have big curiosity on how they do here in the United States, because here yes it is much more common, there is lots fo people that
graduate from the school at home, Oh, well at least before, right now I don´t know
yes, eh, he, that one you know, it is like any other experience, it is like one takes, you know, it can be good or bad
yes, yes, yes, yes
But I also think that is common for the schools here, also here the way the young people are
yes and that can be very bad as well, really
yes that, I would also like her to have, you know, friends and all those things, but at the same time I think I have to protect her
yes, sure, but we have to be careful because later it will be wrong to overprotect them
yes, yes,
it can be very bad
yes, I don´t, but for that reason is that I want to teach her because I can teach anything, but it depends how a present to her
yes
You know
yes, yes
it's a little bit different, we are going to express it like it's presented at school
yes, it's true, and until which year you think give him home schooling?
Oh, I don't know. I haven't think about that, he is only 2 years old
yes,
I haven't started
With time you'll see and know
Yes, so
But, you think, you're planning give him all primary, right?
well, it will probably will be until at least 6th grade
Okay
Then, from there, well keel, because you know, I can teach here all they way to high school
Oh, yes
Oh
So, you have teach all they way up to high school, or what?
yes, yes
Well, And which subjects the most?
Well, I was a special education teacher
Oh
So I was teaching everything
ah, okay, I see
So I, you know, the thing is I, if I don't know something
yeah
If I don't understand the subject, or whatever, I'll teach it to myself so I can teach the kids
yeah, okay, I see
So you know, things like, let's say, algebra
mm
It's not that I don't know it, but it's more like I've forgotten it
yes
Because I don't use it
yeah
So, eh, you know, before teaching the class, what I did was, like I reminded myself
mm
What was it that I had to do
yes, of course
so I could teach them
ah, okay
So for me that's not really difficult, I know that for some other person it could be, but for me
yes but, it's like I say, in high school subjects start to get more specialized, I mean, chemistry and physics are more advanced
And also that time, I know that now
aha
They even have classes that, that the kids can take or the students can take on the computer
yes,
And they can go to a, a high school let's say on the Internet
yes,
So you know, there's many, many, many, options that are not only of
yes, yes, yes
You know, that one has to
yes, no
put them, in a public school also
mm
You know, I know that the Universities here
mm
Have, classes for kids also, in high school that they can take in the University
yes, I've heard about that
So you know, we have many options
Many Very good Lots of luck
And that
But like you also say, I mean they are barely two no You don't have to think too much about that yet
No, as my husband says, you know, that I am a teacher
Okay.
And I'm always reading her books, you know, singing her songs
Uhumm
So that she wouldn't be, you know, so that she's always having fun and at the same time not, uh, she's always learning something
yes, okay
Just so that you know I'm not schooling her formally
okay
But I'm providing for her or educating her
uhum
Little by little, she knows her abc, well she knows the song
yes, she reads
yes, okay, you know, the numbers too
yes,
Just a little bit, you know,if I tell her one, she tells me two, three, then the next, she knows eight comes after seven, you know stuff like that
yes, she knows the order
yes, not all of it, but little by little
yes, that's good
So you know, that way
yes, that sounds, that sounds pretty interesting
yes
I don't know anything, I don't know. SO, if I were in that situation, I don't know what I would do because I would never imagine how
give classes to my son. I could not, because also I tell the truth, I'm not that, I mean. No, I did not have an education on how to give classes, do you understand
Um
I imagine that you have studied something like education, or something like that, no?
Well this
what did you study?
I did study education but they did not teach me exactly, let's say, how to teach a kid to read
yes, no
I had to learn all those things while I was working
aha
Therefre I'm using my experience
of course, of course, of course you adquire all the classes offered
yes. But for that reason, is that, you know, for my dad I did, with, with my sons
um
It's not a problem because I already have the experience, I don't know, you know. Like the other people does it
my name is Mariza
Good afternoon, my name is Lorena I am here in San Antonio, Texas
Hi
hola eh the the topic today is the most touching eh
yes,I too think cost what is the best and what is the worst
exactly, right now I will be the memories I said good memories are as precisely the most important one that can happen in life because one lives, as memories
exactly so eh with so much time and no more passes, but memories are, or would not know which to choose to start
ah
for example the best
so is, well I'm the best mom
yes i too
and maybe if, if I wanted to think the best thing that happened, maybe it is that, having had my children, I remember when I was holding it when I said, this is the best thing that ever happened in all my life, then I
ok.
I say be consistent with that comment that I hize myself at the time was going to have yet other things
wonderful and such can not select only one truth
I was thinking that clear and also wondered if I had not thought of that as his life had been different, if you have not had their children.
yes,yes yes i won't like it
is,is
porque, because ahora ya son grandes ellos me han aportado bueno tantas cosas bellas, no que tal vez yo misma por mi cuenta no hubiera sido suficiente para darme tantos recuerdos y tantos
positive and negative emotions eh, well then not everything is beautiful, not me precisely because I have a child that has some pro, a health problem and that is also very painful, it
yes
and, and well ehm but however they are the emotions more maybe more loving and more tender and more ehm well and the husband is there, right, the husband
yes, and it is that no yes yes but the children, the children
that also has a lot, a lot to do with
yes
in, in one's lie, no and ehm
no
but yes I, I would think that it can not be only one only one only event
sure.
now a painful event, a painful reminder like the death of my mom for example
sure yes the death of a family member or of a loved one has to be the worst thing that can happen to someone
yes yes, yes or the disease of my son, also, no that too
too
it is very painful, but like I say, one can't one uhm say that ust one, but it is beautigul to try to think about it, no
sure like the second part of the question, it was that what, what would it have been from his life that not, if that had not happened, that negative or painful event
uhm yes
that is that it would not be that that person would now be still for example in my case, my mom is alive, but my, my two grandparents both of them passed away some time ago
and I didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye to them because I lived far, then maybe the would be what what would it have been if my life would have been different, of not have because of course they couldn't meet my husband nor my daughter either
so then yes
exactly, exactly hmm
Sure, life would be very different
mhm your husband you met him where?
Here in United States by chance
yeah because you are Spanish
and me yes,Iam Spanish
yeah,yes
and I came here to study but I met him and ended staying and it has been twelve years
yeah
and nothing I have a five year old daughter, I can not say that well my life has changed.sure because children change your life but she is still so little that she still needs some
yes,sure what yes yeah
and then well nothing, don't know is different when your children are older, they became more independent but I still have to go through  that
yes yes,and for real so many things and stages
yes sure,
is but well this age when they are small is so loving
yes the yes everyone tell me the same
mhm it is the most loving, and well once they grow up they make their own life, for example is really pretty but you no longer receive one like the
Today mom I did very well I'am, and oye mom well this is like a level of conversation,like a level
There is not a lot of dependency,there is not a lot of closeness
yes
this but is real nice,the truth is really nice and then for you what would have been the best thing that happened to you, the best memory
well, I think that the, the same as you, the, having kids eh, well I have only one, and I don't think that, I don't know if I'll have more
aha
it was no, no I mean I don't think that I was ready to be a mother maybe because it was a very big change and ah the pregnancy was very difficult and the, ah
the, we have raised her, my hus- my husband and I are here on our own, so it was a bit difficult but also it was of course having a child and your life changes, so well it's the best then that has happened to me I say
for now
yes
eh, you can't compare anything with that I say
yes, true, it's what I also now it has been immediate, I thought that like more has happened well you have very nice memories in life and the achievements you've had
sure
well, as a person, in sports, in or in academic life or at work, no
sure and, and that's why, the other question was if it would have been different if that had not happened maybe if I had not been a mother my life would have been very different
I would have finished my studies all the same, I would have
like that, exactly
sure, achieved a more important career, or I would have traveled more or known a different person, but of course you never know that, you can only imagine.
exactly, exactly and nevertheless you go on accumulating
yes but
memories in photographs of Christmases and in the photographs of school fairs and in photographs of sports festivals of your children
oh
it's like precisely, keep on putting together this life because it's like made out of memories, no
exactly yes, all the photographs that I have are thousands and thousands, they are all of, of my they are all of my daughter, that's why of course, the
it's easy to say that it is the most important, because, besides that, well, I have not travel that much, I've met interesting people, but I don't know if their comparable with
with Kids, I guess
m, because this is like very complete, you don't study to become a mom, you don't study that
No
The human does not study to learn how to love, but finally it's the most complete and deep experience
Yes, that's what I say to my sister, she doesn't have children, I say to her that she is going to be a complete women until she becomes a mother
I say complete because, my sister and her husband have been married for 20 years, but they don't have kids, and I don't think they'll ever have, so, well, It's difficult to explain.
it's difficult to explain
yes, it's difficult to explain, you are not..how do they say..?
but, it's nice to have a kid, because i would have hated to miss that
I have a child because of that, i get to my thirties , i said that was about time, it was now or never, because
for raising a child you have to have plenty of patience and energy, plenty of
plenty of energy, that's right
My daughter requires plenty of patience and sacrifice
yes
and
yes, because she, for example, is really active
she is really active, she is not like I was as a child, i was more quiet, I always did what my parents told me to be
she is like that sometimes
yes, yes
I end up tired, after everyday, but well, she is like that, you have to accept your children as they are
That's right
And
And then you understand why they are in that ways, and everything they will accomplish with a strong and active personality
That's what I think and hope for her
She will accomplish a lot of things, I believe
Yes, I compare her with my nephew, they are so different, I think that my daughter has a stronger personality and that might help her to get better things in the future
Yes, with all the hard things in front of her, the challenges
Of course
Well, my younger daughter is like that and besides being really good in school, is also an excellent athlete
exactly, that's what we want, we want our daughter to get into some sport, but maybe we should wait to get her a little older, because 5 years old seems a little to young for me
she has the body for being and athlete and that might help her to develop more
her personality and having a way to
yes
orientate it
She might get quieter
and get tired
I really need that, sometimes we hit the bed earlier than she, we just can;t do it more
They need to get tired, it's madness
I don't know, someone tells me it's their age
Where do you live?
right now we are in Philadelphia
ah in Philadelphia, I have my oldest daughter studying at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
oh what a coincidence, it is a good university
yes yes yes it is well in Philadelphia
yes, yes here it is a city where many people come to study, many young people one of the most important ones, which is another important thing, education
eh and right
yes of course
of course I would like for my daughter to also go to university, but I have many years left for that
yes but of course she's going to do it. What did you study?
me, Criminal Justice, well psychology but I didn't finish my degree
a-ha, a-ha
well after I got pregnant, the child, we want to raise her at home we don't want to take her to a daycare because we want, don't know, it's the most traditional way how I was raised, they had me in each my parents, they looked after me,
hmm, hmm
we don't want to leave her on her own in a daycare so in the
that well is a good choice
yes yes, it's good eh
I support you  one must take many vitamins to have all the necessary energy
yes  as long as it's possible, right now yes, yes, yes and
and you'll see how when more time passes by yes myself already my youngest daughter turned fifteen yesterday
wow
so then when, when you look back you have still many more memories, many more recollections more experiences of all her achievements too, which are yours because
they achieve things thanks to the support that parents can give them and to the supply of well of everything you are supplying, no as you say well you're leaving aside
perhaps your more personal things, your career, your profession
yes
Well, my name is Claudia Ivette, who am I talking too?
Hello, my name is Juan
oh, nice to meet you Juan
nice to meet you too, where are you?
Where from, excuse me?
ah, where are you?
Ah, I'm here in Idaho
aha
this place is called Robert, where are you calling from?
ah, okay, I'm in Texas, in San Antonio
wow, a little far away
aha, that's where I'm mhm
yes, yes, well, you see, we have to speak about movies
no, yes
well, I really don't know much about movie classification, I don't really understand it, I know that there are some movies that are PG-13, PG
aha
I really have watched some that have lots of bad words on it and they are PG-13, eh, eh, they are kind of violent and more
more, like PG-, PG, PG-13, I've noticed that
aha ah
so, I don't really understand it
Hmm, I don't, I haven't paid a lot of attention to those ratings
yeah
in the end, I don't understand them very well either
yeah
I think they're, a little complicated, they should have instead a little more information about what they have
yes, it's true
but since I don't have small children anymore
yeah
eh, kids, I don't worry too much
yeah
about those ratings, I worry, when we go to watch a movie that it's a movie that's worth it, that has something of interest, not any movie, then the rating
yeah
doesn't interest me as much as the quality and opinions I hear about the movies
yeah
that's that's what draws my attention a little, I don't know if the same happens to you, do you go alone or with someone else?
No, I'm married, I've been married for 3 years, and I do have a child, he's 20 months old
yeah
then he's just a little under 2 years old, and I am worried about what we do, well, my husband more than anything
for example, if we watch a movie, and we love to do that, we like the movie if it's PG or PG-13
yeah
which is what most see, we do not really like him or his adult movies
Aha
it's PC13
ah yes
it's like this sometimes, but the truth strikes us if there is a movie that we like
yes
sometimes we buy it and it has some nude scenes in it, I grab my husband and he deletes that part
ah
and what makes it more important that neither my husband and I are going to keep it is because the kids can get a hold of the movie and see it
and my husband is going to burn the commercial or something
aha
then you can really watch the movie because you will not see better pure truck action
yes
but for example you just delete the part that has a little pornography, because the movie is a good but it has some nude time
yes
and sometimes it has nothing to do with it
there is always something
we have movies that have cars and action and suddenly something happens that has nothing to do with it
if it had nothing to do with it
then we will have to wait because we have other children then so we have to be sure that we're alone before we can see the movie
no there won't be a problem, but
yes yes I think that in that sense you may have a point
yes
ah, for me how curious
yes
what I worry about most in movies is the language and violence
eh yes because really
regulary because like you say when there is an exxageration in the language
yes
o in the violence of most, equal
yes
so when the movies like so -R well evidently they will have scenes of that type
No yes
Those are free and so better-R they seem more restrictive like you don't have much information of the movie are exxagerated in all of the elements
yes, no yes in part for example we have found movies that are for that are for children these aren't for children but to see
passing for the children that are supposedly -PG thirteen that are for children of thirteen years that can see them well, the vocabulary and sometimes there are scenes
of nudity and so, I say it is like they are seeing, well
yes
I don't know, I am Mexican
mhm
Still, for example, on the television they protect you also in the movies they still protect you a bit.
Yes, see that
But I say, um, I don't know, I don't know its very
Recalling the movies that we had seen lately, all of them are
Very fast mhm
PG thirteen or something like that, I don't know where it came from because we had them here
Mhum, Mhum
There not available at the theaters
Mhum
There, there no good
No yes
Then no, we worry a lot because of the informacion since my sons are adolescents we always go together to the theater but
Mhum
We mostly go for the quality of the movie then
Yes
He, in that sense the classification has to be for orientation about the movie, since they really don't give information, no
No sometimes they don't tell you anything because sometimes for example they say
We don't take then into account
And they change for example the things and when you are already seeing it is different from what they said
Mhum
Oh, for example, it ways that is really violent, sometimes it isn't that violent. It doesn't provide the real information
So, sometimes doesn't
yes
Not even myself put attention because of those examples
Yes, i see
Those things they sell, for example, those commercials on Television
what?
they remove all the bad words on TV, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, well I don't have one really..
But i have a friend with one of those things and she says sometimes it works, but other times removes words it should not remove and leave the really bad words
Yes,
So..
here, it those cases, for the education of our kids
yes
we have never censored anything
yes
What we have done it's commenting the scenes if they are strong scenes
yes
we comment them and we decide if it was strong or not, only it's when we are worried
Yes,yes
We analize it, and then take something to educate our children
Yes
In general it works for us because or it worked for u, no now they are grown now.
yes
and what happens at this time, is that they have very good judgement over the movies no, and
yes, notice that it is true, that is the best idea that i remember of my mom when we would watch a movie, anyways we didn't see a movie after ten at night because
we knew that we would be able to find
Oh I see
Or my mom would risk seeing bad movies.
oh I see
Of the type that is not appropriate for some kids but for example sometimes she would say., they wouldn't show a movie and I don't know any other one then some vulgar thing.
Yes
Or something that is not as naked but it is the same, for example small amounts of clothing and when we were girls for example my mom
yea
no daughter, well you guys will already understand more and she would tell us
yes
Because anyways if one says to not turn around, you shouldn't see that then like to an adolescent or to a child, it will begin to sink in, and but why doesn't my mom let me?
of course
If it is a movie of the house and I am going to see because my mom doesn't let me see that part.
Yes no and the thing is that they will encounter it in life, they will always have the opportunity to see all of that.
So then I think not yes yes.
but what is, what speaking of those things is that censorship or information that that supposedly should be censored or
yes
that sort of thing, I have never thought it was good because
no, yes I believe that
there is a lot of other information about movies that are good to watch with your family
yes
and then, after the movie, talk about what happens and educate them around this type of movie, the message, the quality with which it was made, and so on, and so on
yes, yes it's true
because the restrictions they place man- like you say there is violence that is eh in cartoons
aha
there are cartoons that are for kids and they have an exaggerated violence, no
uh, yes and that is not so much in the light of day really
aha, exactly and the and in the and in general I think that eighty per cent of the movies are so bad that you shouldn't watch them
yes not anymore
no and of the other, well maybe some are mediocre and less that five per cent are worth watching
yes
no, but with those you have enough to have a, an idea of what is what you're looking for, no
yes
there is enough, it doesn't mean that they don't make enough movies, but they make so many that you don't have to go and watch all of them, it's, it's
that's right
no and then
that's right
if we try for example to, eh, know who they are before going to a movie, to inform ourselves
aha
about the critics about that movie and then we go
yes
that's not, that's what we try to do when we go to watch this movie
aha
we already have made a decision, about the movies and since, my children since they were small they have, they have had and education because we really like the movies, my wife and I love the movies, so
aha
never, even when we were, they were little
yes
if there was a movie sometimes we would take them even if it was for and older age than theirs, no
aha
and they could see some scenes, no, stronger, but a scene doesn't necessarily make up the whole movie
aha
then we tried to talk about the message, no, for example many war movies, no
yes
many war movies are for example respecting the soldi-
yes, good evening.
Good Good evening I'm Joe
What's your name?
Joe
Joe?
yes, and what's your name?
Alex.
Alex, where are you from?
Ah, eh, I'm here in Los Angeles I think we spoke before about religion.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, of course, I remember, I remem-
We spoke the fourth of October, it's been some time now.
Eh, what a memory. yes, yes I remember, of course.
Where are you from again?
I'm from Colorado. Ah, Denver, Colorado.
Oh, yes, yes.
Well, what do you think of tonight's topic?
Ah. I watch television, based on quality not, not classifications.
yes, me too, I don't pay too much attention to the classification, besides I'm in a class of adult no of course I have a daughter that
always here aware of what she watches I don't want her to see programs that , that will give her nightmares or bad, ah motivations but there are many
many permissive things also like for example, the movies out, well each time are more, I think now they are move violent. I don't know if
Already sufficient in order to classify it because violent movies with many themes come out
Yes. No I think that I am interested in the movies and the television through the theme that it has
Yes
Now it is a violent theme and it has no quality and it is not a good movie. But yes it is a bit violent, and it is teaching us something
like, a documentary or something about life then has value
Clearly
because one cannot deny the truth of life
Clearly
One cannot live life with blind eyes
Like that movie that is, allied, it already came out of the war in Iraq, and I believe it's about the soldiers that, their experience
There is this actor of color, Jamie he's called, I think Jamie Foxx
Yes
And so there is another white guy that seems, is traumatized or something when he is in his experience in Iraq. Those things are very real and that happens there every day.
And those movies can also be political critiques
And yes, true
Of the Bush administration, perhaps it has always been an administration obsessed with war
Yes
With Iraq and fooling the public
Yes, transferring many things outside of the lie that he told in order to invade Iraq, which is really, now that one looks at it, well really
It is not worth having done that, and already two thousand soldiers have died
This people are important because many people are really ignorant in the things that happens in the their live
because there is not information
yes, it's true
The information we have is propaganda, so it's important to look for the other information about what's happening around the world, no only the Bush administration side of the coin
Yes, it's true, Well, I think that classifications now are really relative, I know they have from PG-13, the have the R rated which
are obvious, right?, But I think that the R rating is not very well defined about they can or can't have. I agree that
many movies, right?, don't make any sense, for example, there are many gangster movies, so, many of the real gangster go and watch it because they
Mm
need to see violence
Those movies are bad
Yes, really bad
Because they teach violence
And glorifies it in a way
Yes, and they don't make them for values, it just for sellng
And that is not for sale
to certain people
because some younger boys start dressing the same, or walking of talking the same they watch, because it's like a hero
that's not right, it corrupts the young people. Those Programs, those movies, they teach wrong values, and that is not good, but also
society, parents, families, they have a lot of the work in helping children to understand those things, right?, My kid, when she
when I'm watching something like that, if I don't want, i mean, i don't force it in that ways, saying like: Okay, don't watch that
or, I try in a educational way to teach her why this show isn't good for her, instead of forcing her, en other words
Uh, So do I, I have a fourteen year old soon
Mm
and each time he comes visit I have to setup parental control on sex channels
Oh, yes
Because he is obsesed with that, each time I go to work, he is  watching that
Yes, it's easy
Tehn when I setup the parental controls he is unable to watch them, but he is controlled only because i wanted to place those parental controls
yes
Not because ratings, Then, is the work of each mom and dad to control what their children are watching, is not fair to blame the classifications
Yes, exactly. At home I have the basic cable, so, there is not a channel which is over the line
Do you have teenagers?
No, I have a five year old girl
Oh, a girl
then, there is a Disney Channel she really likes to watch, we also watch Discovery Channel, she likes it, and there is also other
comedy show which isn't over the line that we both watch. She likes to laugh, she likes the funny things
but, when there are somethings over the line, well, I don't let her watch those things, because I don't want her to learn some bad things
This is made when it isn't morally or socially correct
yes, you can teach your kids, but the reality is that  we, as parents, can't stay with our eyes closed, specially when
they are growing, because they will have more temptations than the ones we had
yes, e-
Not because we're good parents but because the culture
The culture is more
because the culture nowadays with teenagers they're more ah, gangs ah, hip hop music lots of sex, lots of violence
The videos.
the videos
yes, all of those things
and ah it's not easy to control all of that you try to and you, I tried to explain him what I, the consequences of what can happen if he gets into all of that
if he does that if he has sex with a girl there can be lots of consequences that, that he can hav-, that can happen, you know?
yes.
You have to, uh, talk with them constantly because some things I've seen with parents because I I'm a substitute teacher in the schools
yes.
they take care of their kids really well when they're five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten years old, but when they're growing up and need the most help the parents are doing I don't know what
they start to fail and these kids have lots of temptations and
The teenage years are a critical age.
and at that age when you're a teenager is when you have to get into life more and the kid
Exactly.
no just when you're five or six years old.
It's just that the way of reasoning and thinking, they say, we were teenagers too, I remember how I acted back then in
that I had my rebellious spirit and all that but it's when you need your parents' guidance the most.
E--Exactly. Exactly. Therefore everything depends on the education of the parents, the--the way in which they are involved in the life of the children, and not, not on the--not on the classifications.
A classification is only a number.
Yes. And if one comes to see it is how, when they are alone with their little friends, they can watch what they want since there is no one to forbid it.
Yes.
Eh, but if one helps him by setting a good foundation in, in regard to what is good and what is bad; that helps him a lot to think before acting.
Taking a wrong action
You have to give the boys foundations, about what is good and what is bad, not just when they are five or six years old, but also when they are fifteen, sixteen, eighteen years old.
Exactly.
And it is more important when they are fifteen years old than when they are five, since when they are five they are going to follow rules easily.
Yes.
But when they are already fourteen or fifteen years old, it's another, friend.
And they think they are more independent, that they don't need their parents.
Yes, now they have friends, now, they are already involved in the culture.
Yes.
The father or the mother have to work, they don't always have time, it is very difficult
Yes, the influence of young people nowadays is very large, I--I agree, although I remember I also had my--my influence from friends when, when I was a kid an all that...
... but I can see that because of the technology and all that stuff, well, it is even greater. Because, really, the movies from the time when I was a kid were not as violent as they are now.
There were no video games, television was much more restricted, no--none of this modern violence was shown at all, not the blood and the body like in CSI and all those shows that are pict--classics...
That show stuff as if they were real.
Mmm...
Well, what it does, is that the adolescent brain gets used to seeing those things as it grows, these things are learned and it has caused chaos.
In fact, it wasn't permitted in all cases, but it is true, the mentality is changing, and, because of this, eh, the youth have a great influence
large and negative that these things are permitted in society.  And I well
Yes
I, I believe that when my daughter gets to the time of, of adolescence, that I am there
Yeah, it will be soon, my friend.
Yes, I know, time goes quickly.
Time flies.
I remember when she was a baby, and now she is jumping and running all around and learning many new things, and is curious and asks a lot of questions.
Hello, my name is name is Marisa from Philadelphia
Hello, Marisa, is Carolina, from here, from Los Angeles.
Hello, good evening.
Eh well, well, here is good afternoon
Oh, that's right, is three hours ahead, yes.
Oh, I said, good heavens, how is it going to be? Hey, today we had a hard topic
Very hard, yes.
Oh, dear, because I'm from Venezuela.
Mm.
Where are you from?
I'm Spanish.
Oh, okay
Well
And, and you know that now we are living a very critical moment, precisely, with the United States and the, our new president
yes.
and then oh dear
Yes, well, something similar happens to me, what I have to say about the United States is also not very positive, because ah mm, I'm also not from the left, anyways, so well
Wow,
of the, of the United States really is,
is tough, is
it's very str-
heavy, and including, I don't know if you, just so happen to know, if you know a website called eh, TV for all
and there you can watch television channels
No.
from all over the countries of the world, including, Spain.
Ah, yeah.
Aha, it's called like something, T V uh, T, uh, T V four
T V for all oh
yeah, four four and all A L L as in television for everybody, something like that.
Oh.
there, well there you can watch, well, we sometimes like to, we've been watching this particular Venezuelan channel
Mhm.
and, it's a channel, where supposedly the state, but actually now the state, it's not like it used to from the state, but it wasn't like
Mhm
and so then we can eh, actually watch the true, what is going on there, what they never talked about and especially that our president is a rather
like we say here in Venezuela, clear and refreshing
Mhm.
uh, I don't know if you have had the opportunity to listen to it before?
Well I think that yes. Yes, on television and after that. The peaks of America and everything that was happening over there.
Exactly, exactly, we-
yes, yes. They put it up in there, in Philadelphia, there are several Hispanic channels like Telemundo, Univision.
Aha, it's the same here.
Galavision and all that stuff.
It's pretty much the same in here.
And you can listen to everything, yes, and
But you know, those people unfortunately, well, I mean, they show what they want
It's not like, that happens here too, it's controlled by the government, I mean, let's say
Exactly, exactly
eh, we only hear what they want us to hear
Correct. That's right, they even change the facts
Mhm.
they change the facts of what's happening and so I always come across people that say, for example, they tell me, what do you think about that crazy President of yours? and
I, oh dear mother, they've hit the jackpot! Well, the truth is that I agree with that crazy man, ah, well, what I meant to say is that
I wanted to say, that, they use it to say a lot of crazy things, right?
Mm.
and oh my God, I had to be patient because it's a tricky subject.
yes.
so, I've even had some problems here, with people from Venezuela.
Mm.
ah, people that have been living here for a long time and they don't know what's really going on in Venezuela.
yes
and apart from that, they are afraid of the idea that they have been sold, that communism, that I don't know how long Fidel and that and the other,
well, I don't know really, you have so much knowledge, but, for example, the situation that we are living in Venezuela is very special
Mhn
very peculiar for Venezuela, nothing to do with the Cuban reality, with what happened in Cuba, they had to..
adopt that system eh, which necessities forced them to assume that system and, what happened during the time in
which they were applying that, because there were mistakes, like with everything else, as we have also made some mistakes right now
Yes sure
We have been making mistakes, but, we are working on that, as the President says, he has a complain against the
government, not against the country, but against the governmet from here, they are the ones
Sure
who assume the policies that they want, as they want arbitrarily eh
yes, well no, they have become the world police, they are the ones who become the
Exactly
bosses of all, and, and tell you what is going to happen, and if you don't agree, then the hard way, you have to agree
Exactly. Correctly, so and if not I blackmail you
Mhm. Exactly.
Aha, then wow, eh
With embargo, with, with whatever, the hard way, with violence, ay, with war
Exactly. Exactly, it is a very,very ,,,situation
This
delicate, but I believe, and from what I have seen I feel, that NOrth Americans like, in some way are like, waking up, I feel
Uh huh.
that there are a few more people that are like realising what is really happening, because also they're kept like in a bubble
They still miss a lot, and that, that's what makes me
Yes.
Makes me angry because it's very clear - well, if you know that two plus two equals four and you see how people are manipulated
You're right.
And you try to say that to someone, "Look, this is how it is, this, and this, didn't you realize?" Then they say no to you, because you were
liberal, or communist, or I mean, well, you
You're right.
They label you and
Yeah, labels follow, and bad ones too
Bad, you're bad, yeah, you're a terrorist or you're anti-, anti-... Get out of here, we don't want you if you don't like it
That's right.
And I say, But, this country, The bad isn't the country, it's the leaders of the country
Exactly, that's what they say to me sometimes. "What are you doing here?"
Yes
I tell them, look, I could be in Venezuela and not support the president, I mean, the fact that you are in
country or not, I mean if you left your country that doesn't mean that you're taking a position
Mhm.
nobody knows the reasons for the people to be there
Sure
in, eh, at  some point, nothing to do with the opposition, because, how many people in Venezuela do not live in Venezuela, and what they are doing is complaining
to the Venezuelan government and the people
Mm.
so, so don't have to be here or there to support or not to support, so, it is a very very,, it makes me laught when they tell me that
yes
because What are you doing here? And well, same as you, thank goodness. You are here, no in Venezuela.
No, but he, it is the same in Spain, but it is different, left-wing government, but even a right-wing, it is another mentality because when the
people does not agree takes the streets and, and make demonstrations, and you don't see that here, I have never seen it.
Correct, correct, right.Look with all the problem about the petrol, that is, has been, but look
Oh. Mhm.
in a susprisingly big way, the people can not take it anymore, but they don't protest, and I say My G-d but, What happens with the people? so..
..supposedly when it affects your pocket then you react, but it doesn't seem like that, I don't knows what is happening, do they change cars and buy a more economic one-I don't know
yes
I don't know what happens, but they don't have, in general,they don't have that need to protest on some issues
yes
but I tell you, I don't know, suddenly here You are in Pennsylvania, you told me?
yes Philadelphia, yes
In Philadelphia. I don't know, but I feel that there's a bit more of that, people is starting to wake up
Mm.
I feel like they are rejecting policies, the policies from our current President and they are looking at things the wrong way, they are presenting them to them like
me too, at the beginning I had no access to that and that website was like, my God, is it true what they are saying there in Venezuela? But I would talk to my friends and
and they would say, no girl, what's that? Look, I, that's a lie, but you see, the power of television is
yes.
very big, well speaking of that, power
Power, yes.
and television has a huge power.
yes, they control us, I mean, yes, here
Sure.
eh, here in Philadelphia we are a democratic city, everyone here is Democrat but the rest of the State are Republicans, and the people, the people from the United States, they, they tell you things
I don't know, very, radical
That's right.
very dangerous, so close, oh yeah, so
yes, yes, yes, yes.
He can't, it's not going to change, so, while that changes, well
Sure, sure, what are you doing there in Philadelphia?
I, oh well, I live here with my husband, we moved here from Florida about a year ago, we used to live in Florida, and
Okay.
Here looking for work, we finished moving and
Oh, and you like it there more than Miami ?
we're in process of mm, well i liked that more, what happens is that him, the work issues is a lot better here in north, there in south is a lot more saturated
Okay, okay
And, what you're going to do ? works is first, first place
Right, right, and fi-, and here, what you do ?
He is, eh, he works in the pharmaceutical industry, doing, clinical research ah
Okay, okay
and i, look, i work as administrative, ah, voluntary and
Okay, whatever you get, right
mostly what, whatever i encounter. Right
But, from how you've been around here in United States ?
Well like twelve years
Twelve ?
Mhm
Ay, mother. I have six here, and we are about to return if God lets us
yes, when i got here, they had Bill Clinton, and the country was like, it was, in like a incredible phase with lots of work, every one happy, the economy was going up
yes, right so
afterwards the republicans got in, eh, with Bush and it all started to fall down, like they say
yes, sir, right so, and
It's going to hell little by little, it's, I don't know, the world, when I'm in Spain
yes
when I go to Spain, everybody, the, my husband is American and people look at him in anger, they have lots of hard feelings against them, they tell him, look, your country is
destroying the world, they are taking over everything and
Ah, oh my God.
you think, you feel, you think that you know, you own the world and
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
there are lots of hard feelings of their power
yes, you see and I would also get into that game but now I understand that it's not like that, we are not, we are not
to blame for what our government does.
Sure.
So, I would also look at American people and would treat them badly but now, I have understood that they are not to blame, and that they are people from the United States, they are not Americans, that's a badly understood term, isn't it? So,
Aha.
well, we are American too, if that's the case
Sure.
and, and, so I started to think of that and no, no, they are not North Americans, no, it's the government, oh well, they do
they decide, they do, so, sure, it does reflect the people of the country
Mhm.
but, it's not like that, the State, it's the politics, the government.
and, I don't like that, I'm like, I'm from Spain and I'm American and I here need, it would seem that I like it but I
Sure.
eh, and I have to wait and have to wait what he does government, but I don't know either, I don't like it, he is a
Of course, of course. yes, no, and you have, you have the right precisely, for being in a democracy you have the right to protest.
Of course. Well, but theory, practice, don't say anything, or else
I. Oh, exactly, exactly, not me, I hope this, the, the
Mm. It is like a regime, yes.
Not affected anything the, eh the that linguistic project but, at least is a really controversial topic, when I listened
Very
the topic, I was dying, I was saying
Me
why? Why
I say, I am going to speak about Bush, because see that I have  a lot, a lot of anger that I have to speak about Bush and leave to him bad because
But okay, thank God, you are not alone. I listen many people saying, they don't talk but rant of him and I say
yes, yes, yes
certainly people are realizing, besides of
That is that
they think people are so stupid that they are  not going to
Mhm.
tell about the stupid things they are doing, for God sake
No, stupid things and then, and, and, everybody takes, takes the hands to the head, oh my God, this can't be true, anything
and not, to, the next week they forget the situation because
Sure.
The newspapers and the TV, they show you other thing let's say to, to, to distract, something to distract, then people forget.
Sure, look, yes, and you know that recently, here finished the film festival and Latin American
Mhm.
And by the way, the presented a movie, eh from argentina, but the director were Spanish
Mhm.
and so, so interesting, because you know the Spanish films have many protest movies, a film of
yes
documentary kind, eh where
Mhm.
Well, my name is Ibet, with whom do I have the pleasure?
Mercedes speaking.
Hi Mercedes, how are you? Where are you from Mercedes?
From Honduras.
Oh, from Honduras?
Mhm.
Wow. My brother-in-law's wife is from Honduras too.
Ah, from where?
Ah, no, no. Eh, I don't know, but I know that she is Honduran too.
Oh, how nice.
Yes, she is.
And you where are you from?
I'm from Mexico.
Ah. From where? The city, eh, capital?
From the city. yes, from Mexico City. yes. And
And what do you think about today's subject? What if it's more eh it's easier to break up with someone young or, or if the age makes a difference.
Mm, look, okay. I already passed that stage and I'm now married, but for example ah mm, well I don't know. The experience that I had was, was very difficult
I feel that it's difficult when you really love the person when really you don't love her I think that it's like anything, okay, it's fine, let's break up, okay.
Each for their own part.
Uh huh.
The, I believe that when you really love the person but in this case, I imagine that it is because you didn't get along with the person
or or because really I don't know, maybe they didn't want to get along between the, between the two people, I believe that there must be more than anything
a communication in relationships
Mmh.
I mean between, in the relationship.  And if there is one, une of the two parts starts to lose the, there is going to be lack of trast and starts
to deteriorate the communication, then I believe that can can cause a break but yes, I know that, I feel that it hurts.
And some time did you have a difficult break up?
Mm. Well. Eh, really yes, yes, yes because for example, before I married my husband eh, I was with someone and, for example, eh
in any case, not very long time, but the first, my first boyfriend
yes?
then this
It is always difficult.
I lasted a bit of time with him, it was not long but it was the first illusion I had, I don't know, and and I already was, I had said, well, and I even said no, well I am going to marry him
eh, I am going to have three children and I was already building castles on air when one time he cane and said, you know what? Not I, here it ends.
How?
Mm.
I believe there was, he had more experience of saying, here it stops what do I say, uh then I believe that for him, uhm
it was not so difficult, but for me yes
Mmh.
And, after that now yes, everything was for the better, because after that I met who is now my husband and wow, it is much better
the truth
that's good
so i don't know.
i mean you've only had two boyfriends,
yeah that's right
that's good, better, why? why involve yourself in problems
what about you?
when there's no necessity.
yeah and how did it happen to you?
well, i haven't had a date in a long time, i don't go through that, but i think I've had a difficult experience before.
ha
I was with this guy, yea with my first boyfriend, we were together for two years.
ha
mm i remember we just chose to stop dating, i don't remember when though.
ha
but um, this was ten years ago.
wow
i was nineteen, he was eighteen.
are you married?
yea
Oh
And after we, well, we stop seeing each other. After,it was not easy because
Yea.Yea.
After, with another guy who I used to go out with,we went out a few months,also he did not live where I did,where
Yeah
we were,In the University where we were and he went back to his country of origin
Yeah
and that one was also easy because by done one stops seeing him and rap-o that is is easy well right
yes
in that manner
yes
Eh What else? let's see what else,after that I had no other formal boyfriend until S-more then,for real the experiences that I never had any mane-experience like I do not even know,right? thank God.
Yeah,No.yes is that sometimes,don't know well for example I believe that in in my case eh,with the first person I think that I had too many feelings for
well it was a lot
Mhm
more then the,the of then he fell for I believe with,And it was not a long time I think that it was two or three months.
Mhm
But,same I was flying because they said ah,this is my first boyfriend and I would probably marry him and that stuff.
yes
and in-and he I think he did not think the same. he said well her, I do not know if I was his third or forth fifth don't know
But i said, yes, well I'm not gonna marry her, I'll just hang with her and meet her, and that's it. Instead, well, i think, i was the one who made illusions about that
and yeah, it really hurts.
Right
Er, yes, it hurts because i think that you're excited and you have a lot of faith in that relationship, and when a person comes and says 'no', well, it just.
But i think there must be, it must hurt a lot more when you're living with that person as a marriage.
Yes.
I thing that must be the worst experience, i think, of your life, yes, and i hope, i hope i never have it because, we don't know, ¿right?
Uh um.
Then i hope i never, until now, I've been married for three years, and everything is working, well, not perfect, but everything's fine.
Thank god.
A lot of communication and stuff like that.
You say that it's nothing well, everything can be perfect, it's true, always, and also
yes
Because there's people who are mistaken, there's people that thinks, oh, marriage is the, it's according to the time of, uh, and it's all peacefulness
No.
But you live with the people day and night and you look at the peop- i mean
Yes.
It's impossible to maintain a, ¿right?, a situation like that, like
No, yes.
If you always love the person, well it's impossible for it to be only peace, that's what I'm saying, ¿right?
yes
because one, because I, I'm one, It's human and one has to, things that very upset other people, right? and
yes
see- to anyone alse, well I'm not saying the person you're with particularly, but anyone else, what do I know
eventually, well like that, we have a saying, no, not everyone's penny, all the day, twenty-four hours a day, for every other day, well
that's it
yes
yes, the truth me bein- i think it has to be something for real, eh very hard eh, keeping it everything happy, right? but
hmm
and i think that also that and i think that huh when you're in your relationship, for example you can know and, as you meet the person
that, of course, you aren't meeting him profusely, right? until you're already married with that person but it's but i think that i think that
if you see that really you don't get on with that person and for example I've met people eh that hit their boyfriends being boyfriends, they hit them, and treated them bad and forced them to everything they wanted then
i think this relationships are never going anywhere good because if they aren't married then
and to treat
and they already treat them like that how is it going to be when they're married, as soon they're going to say you're my owner
yes. yes.
yeah how they treat them then i think that that one that those relationships eh i think they're never going to work, i don't know. or, either he changes or
or he changes or the relationship is over like that, i think that if it is a relationship like that well i i think it shouldn't hurt at all, on the contrary off
you should rest if you have a boyfriend that hits you or something
hmm
you are going to rest, you are going to say, ah, that's great that we finished.  I don't know.  And I think that if for example everything starts to get along and all
everything is wonderfully and all of a sudden someone, I don't know, has go to for example, to another country or needs to go to another school,  I think that there it would also hurt a little
yes.
Because, everything is fine, but only for third circumstances, since they must separate.  Then, I think that in that type of relationship, well it does it does hurt, but if it is a relationship like that that
that they hit you and things like that then no
Oh, no, yes, that.  Bu-, and what, what is ehm, ironic is that Ehm, those are usually the ones that, there are times that those are relationships that are more difficult
for that, for the people that are in-, involved in that type of relationship
That yes.
because usually, well ehm, people do, when one is in that type of situation it is, there is like a self-confidence that is too low
Aha.
and then they think in that, that people think that this is what, is the best that I'm going to be able to some time ehm, what I will be able to get
I have to put up with it, I have to continue putting up with it, since
yes.
and then ehm, it really that it is not so easy like on thinks that oh, he already did this, I am going to send him to the tubes, no
That is true
It is difficult, rather, because uhm, it becomes like no, is like it, not to say addict, but if to the, to that type of situation in which
the drama is __-, it is, ehm, a lot, right? and and then people don't know how to leave that cycle of, of abuse, right? that is what happens
That yes, yes, yes true, you are right because
yes, but
for example one time in, when I was in Mexico, I met a girl that eh, one time came with some black lenses to her jo-, job.
Mhm.
And I told her, And now you with glasses? Was cloudy the day, really And she had a hit that her boyfriend did to her.
Ah.
And I told her, you should, I told her, I believe you can't allow, I don't know, I told her, but, I think you can't allow him to touch you
your boyfriend and she said, well it is, it is too difficult to end the relationship with him, and I told her, why? she says
in spite of everything I love him.
Mhm.
And then, wow, I gave- What? How can be possible that you love to some person that hits you, that beats you? sometimes she came eh, bruised, or sometimes eh
Oh.
He gave her slaps or something like that
Oh,no
Then like you say sometimes that kink of relationships are the hardest. And at the end when she could do it I remember that she was the one that cried and cried and cried any
any time she could cry in the breaks and such things because she missed him and so on. Then, I believe yes, in some way sometimes eh
some relationships, I believe that, I imagine that to her was very painful
Carolina
Fabiola
whats up?, fabiola?, how are you? mm
fine , and you?
well, well. Where are you?
in washington? yes
oh mother, too far away
and you?
I'm in Los Angeles
Uf
yes
extremes
we are just extremes, good. and where you from?
Chilean
from where?
Ehh, Chillan Chile
Oh, Chilean, Ok, Im fromo Venezuela
from Maracaibo
No, no. why? you know people there?
yes, i know some people from Maracaibo
Oh, I see, I see. Well, you know, they have a strong accent. Right? Like, you and I. Mm.
Eh, yes, yes.
Aha.
you and I, are you Arepa?
ah, yes, yes, yes. Oh good, that's good. Sometimes is hard to find people from Venezuela, they say, no, no, we really know only a few people from Venezuela and this and that, and I, oh my God.
Only a few live here. But, in around ten, um, mm, in the past ten years I think the number has grown.
yes.
Mhm.
I know, a know a girl from Venezuela that lives in Houston.
Mhm, oh. Do you work at the Hilton?
No, no, no, no, no. In Houston, in the
Ah, I thought you had said Hilton. Ah, oh my God. Oh, okay, okay.
Texas. No, no, no. I work from home. In my house.
Okay, okay, perfect.
Do you work?
Yes, I work with deaf children.
Oh
Aha, well, right now, I'm really working with parents with deaf children. Mhm.
that's a great job!
Yes, yes, it's hard.
Yes, but it gives you satisfaction to have
Yes
the power to help the people
Exactly, exactly, and the same thing happened in Venezuela, only it was done with sign language
There I learned the alphabet in, in
Okay, okay. Chilean, of course, no?
Yes yes
Mhm
But, with signs
Correct, but here it's oral
Here they taught my daughter the alphabet, eh, some words
okay
Not all, some like I love you and stuff
Mhm
Yes, little words
Mm, okay
But beautiful
Yes yes yes, now I am, it is in the oral part. No? I am like in the other extreme of the, of the
of the profession. Because this is, here they encourage the kids to speak
What do they speak?
Mhm.
Without listening, but, let them speak, let them
yes, no, yes. They have, they can hear through hearing devices.
Ah.
So, they do, they train you so that you can recognize the sounds.
That's so nice.
Mhm, mhm, yes, yes. It's like a possibility that they have, they can speak. They won't speak perfectly, you will notice the difference but
But they will have that option, so. Some parents even mix the sign language with the oral part, right? It depends on the
hearing loss level of the kid. If it's a deep loss where you are not able to have that possibility even with the best surgery, so, there
eh, they use sign language as a complement.
that's a tough job for parents to do.
Mhm. It's a huge job, it really is, it's tough. But, it's it's rewarding, at the end of the day, they are rewarded. Sure, they have to work really hard, as we say.
Otherwise, well, they will hardly make it.
And what do you think about today's subject, about the?
Oh well, it's an incendiary subject, it really is. Well I think that couple relationships are not simple, you have to deal with someone that
it's different to you, that comes from another world, another culture, another way of living and you have to work together for a common project, like
ah, sometimes, it's quite hard, right? I think that love is the only thing that help us get over the difficulties, just that.
If there's love, if there's a will of the couple to overcome all those differences, then, this problems that they could face over time,
well, they will overcome them, do you agree?
yes, sure. I think that it must have something more than love because love
Mhm
is aquired by time
sure
and and with win, then , I believe that you would want to keep a family you have to want a family because there is many people that love
Mhm
and they are so young, the first thing the think of whrn they get the opportunity is fight and separate
Correct.
they don't work hard, and they love they love each other maybe more then a couple that has been married thirty years
sure
but they fight day in and out and they pass problems they pass on top of the problems.
Correct.
and I believe that is what is needed people today to have patience y-n
yes
think whether you decided to stay with that person or marry that person,
sure.
well it is forever now,even when there are problems,to not get out running on the first problen that you find.
sure.well note that I mm, my husband we have,have almost eight years of marriage
and me twelve.
and twelve imagine and and for real we have had well,two critical moments, at the point of separation. and there came a time that maturity set in. it plays an important role No?
yes
I, in other moment of my life, I would have left.
Me too.
Aha.
I wouldn't have cared about anything, but,
I wouldn't have cared about anything, anything.  But, look, not even a bit.
ah, I say like that, that if I fall, I get up again.  What is the problem?
Exactly
But now I think about it three times.
Of course.  Then, now really I think about it and say, no, but he has other things.  I mean, I, I focus on the good things he has, I say, he is different than me, he cannot think like me, and I don't have a reason to get upset if he doesn't think like me.
But, neither do I want to let that affect me.
Ah, of course.  I do the same.
No? I mean, exactly.  Then, fortunately, well, eh, the first time was rather horrible, because I thought it was the end of the world.  And, well, there we were, and we lasted a good time that we were not dealing with each other until one day I said, well, but, what is happening?
We have, we had almost three weeks.  Never in life had we lasted three weeks without, without talking to each other.  And, sleeping on the same bed.
Oh, my God.
Mm, horr-, horrible, horrible.  I told him, loo, you know what? yes, it seems to me.
It hasn't happened to me.  I haven't gotten to that.
listen, no, terrible, a great immaturity on our part, really.  I told him, you know, it seems to me that this is a trunk of immaturity.
We don't have, I mean, this doesn't make sense.  If you want to continue with the project, we continue.  If you don't have to continue, we don't continue it.  I love you.
I love you.  But, we cannot continue like this, because you go on one side and I go to another.  And, really, believe me that I love you.  And, because I love you,
it is that I need for us to define this.  Because, it is stupid on our part, to live like this.  In addition, a place like this, God doesn't bless.  So,
Let's get the batteries. because,regardless of however serious the situation might be, which , fortunately was not a serious thing, but umm ,as if neither both wanted to twist the arm
It was the pride
The foolish pride. because, it
if that doesn't work at all
For nothing. all the opposite
affects only
exactly. then, well, fortunately, we take up again the course. and then,had another, and yet, this was lower. I think that was really the first part that we
and was well, well, what's more,I was ready,as we say here, about candy . I said, nothing ends here.
candy is as ready to throw in the towel
Yes. ready to throw in the towel. I said, nothing, no, no, no, no I will not I will allow, I say. do not allow it,I say. do not permit it,I mean you are wrong.
if anything I learned in this life is to find solutions for things that can be.
Clear.
because we're going to do with a mediocre relationship? I do not want a mediocre relationship.as you say, people who spend up to thirty years together, that's a pigs relationship.
Yes?
that they are treated badly. no piece of that thing, what is that? that I want?
mm. no, is-a girl, and sometimes they are treated well, but not love
Accurate, well
are, pass all their lives together
yes, yes, yes. look, is that they spend thousands of things,of truth. so much happens in couples it is a very interesting topic, because, you say,
there are really people looking, they take it super of the best, but do not want. as good, I used to live with it.
No?  They just respect each other, and,
Exactly
and, what they wanted to was to form a family, and that's it
Exactly.  There are others that don't.  There are others that defi- definitely do whatever they feel like doing and w-, and they maintain a good image.
No?  And, there are others that say, love.  If there is not love, there isn't anything.
There isn't anything, there isn't anything.  It really must be  a great, a great love.  That's why I say, because I feel that in my relationship, what could was love.
Because to tell you the truth, with a situation so, so difficult, like the one we live in, if there wouldn't have been love, right there there wouldn't have it, no, it would have ended, as simple as that.  Because, it really did not make any sense.
It didn't make sense to continue something that, eh, where there was no love.  So, I feel that yes.  Lots of love, and a lot of that compromise that you talk about, of loving for real,
to be there because you want to, because it is worth it.
Because, of course, nobody forces you.  You want to be there, and, and you fight.  And to keep yourself, ___
Exactly, exactly.
You might have a partner, it is difficult.  When you have one, you have t-
Exactly.
the most difficult thing, after that, is to maintain it.
Su- that is the most difficult thing yes, it is.  And, to look for, like to be constantly in that, ehm, ehm, in that harmony that, that, like about new things, of let's do this differently, let's do now, to not fall in that routine.
Ehm,
But, no.  Is that the time comes in which you know the same, but, the important thing is that you can get out of it
Exactly, of course it is.  To realize it.
And that the system leads you to that just the same.
Sure.  Sure. Your husband is Chilean as well?
No, he's from here.
Oh, imagine that. Is a little bit more. I mean, is not that is harder. Really, I think that love can conquer all.
So easy, I say.
You think is easier?
For, well for some things, easier.
Oh, okay, okay, Because my husband is from Venezuela, and,
For some
and sometimes, I say, I think that has nothing to do with the nationality. I think those are universal things.
yes, I think for me is easier because sometimes, they are more entertaining because I don't understand what he says, then it doesn't go well, no, didn't have a reason to fight
a lot with him, because I find it funny.
And what, what was it you told me?
what are you saying? Oh when we were super
Bad.
Hello.
Hello.
Halo.
Hello, hello, how are you?
Well, I am Viola from Idaho.
Ah, from Idaho, very well. I am Alicia from Atlanta.
From Atlanta.
Yes.
Oh, how are you?
Fine, and you?
Fine, fine.
That's good, and where originally?
From Chile
really? me too.
Really?
yes.
Oh, that's good.
That's funny.
And how long have you lived here?
yes. Well more or less in the for example I'm here all of two thousand three.
oh, okay.
and what's it called, and of course then I went and came back but more or less the ninety-one, yes. And you?
I am living here since two thousand two.
Ah, it's not so much, for nothing, for nothing.
no it was not so long ago, it was a short time ago
And from Santiago surely
yes, from Santiago.
Of course.
And and you, where are you from?
oy, I lived.
From Santiago too?
Of course, there in Santiago I lived the and in Concepción.
Oh, okay
Of course,
Look how. how small the world is.
Yes, exactly. Sounds good.
And have you been in this thing long? Of calling by telephone?
Because no, I don't know what, I wrote the Monday to do
oh yes?
and i didn't know anything else about that
hello?
i mean hello, yea
oh okay
oh i hope my phone doesn't start acting up again
oh okay
no but i meant it has been, it has been taking calls, what do i know
ok, are you calling everyday?
Well i started again, and they called me four times but i only answered once.
oh okay
yes
yes, yes they also called me this week, i coundlt pick up
well uh
week, I've been kind of lazy
of course, why not
yes
I'm telling I've been
yes
having fun giving a theme for
to talk, for talking i think
no ah, yes that must be
yes, I think so.
I thought I used to think that this was like this this this study to make like a phone menu an things like that
Eh
Well for hospitals and theaters and things like that and then they wanted for people to talk things regarding health and things like that, for example.
What happens is that they told me that they gave topics because like that you suppose you don't have to talk about personal things
Ah, because union shouldn't of because one does not want to do it?
because one shouldn't shouldn't like things that are very personal.
Ah,
Because you never know the other person on the phone, because
Ah of course, ah, ya.
then that is why they give you subjects to have something to talk about
Ah, OK, I thought because it was part of the study that they wanted to hear words in Spanish or in Castilian what do I know.
oh OK
no but no.
yes the only thing they told me is that we had to talk subjects like subjects like without importance but
Of course with.
having like a subject, not to just talk about stupid stuff.
Of course.  It is the fruit
Because yes that.
yes.
That. Yes, and you like it here?
No, it's no that good in Idaho right now.
Eh.
I was in Washington around the Seattle area when I first got to the United States, of course
Eh,
and that, I'm in Georgia, I'm south, I'm good as well because the band is all here where I live in Atlanta and
go ahead and set it here
Eh.
but Idaho is such a rural state so no.
it is a field and all of the fields are good,
yes, I guess the same is not dependent.
yes, it's a medium area so I don't know about a night life, so I know
Oh yeah I guess. Oh, the thing is that I'm in Atlanta and it's a fairly large city. Supposedly the life here should be really fantastic.
two or three years.
Eh.
Also because of all of the businesses and the bars ant the clubs that have to close in the morning.
Hello, the two.
at two in the morning, all are closed.
Oh, and that
Well the reason is that the area like that and thing in Atlanta it is called Buckhead.
eh
and like, and already like two, three years ago there was crime and stuff, and three people were killed.  They killed three people.
Oh.
There, then the city now with a new mayor and what not, then now people well are killing
Oh
but in any case it is but it is like like yes, a city like that has to ha for the population
yes, well.  And like but, there do people use cars a lot or is there public transportation?
Ah, no there are lots of cars, too many cars, yes.
We, ah well in any case because going out at two in the morning is not so
well it is that
if you have a car or something like that.
Of course.  It is not bad it is for example I would prefer a thousand times to have a a system so so god because of the simple problem of
expensive and also that
yes
too much congestion
Oh, OK
then, of course it is like horrible traffic, I mean it takes time like anywhere yes like
yes.
yes, the car.
here it is totally different.
Ah yes like there.
Well, there are lots of cars.  People here have cars everybody because it is a necessity, something like that.
Of course.
because there is no public transportation.  But,
Ah.
it is like no no it takes so long, like to go everywhere, the city were I live is like half the size of Santiago but there are much fewer people, because
It's like that.
because you know here things are like houses are bigger, they are more separated, things like that.
Of course.  Of coures, they are in o
And I am not in Idaho Falls.
Ah, OK OK.
in Idaho Falls
OK,
En, I go to a bigger city then.
Mm.
There in a bigger city but
Of course.
where we are no, it is country
Ah how great, it is the same like clearly.  Eh and it gave a thing there like it is what is the University of Washington
Ah.
We were latino. And
Here there is not art like there are machines
Yes, all ready
There is Mexican art and because it's more of a rural area
Mhm
They hire Mexican artists to do work in
Ah.
the land and things like this
Oh, clearly
So almost always Mexicans are seen. The people confuse you for a Mexican.
Clearly, yes, yes
Besides latinos, it is said that there are Mexicans
Clearly, the wheat
So you have to walk saying no no no
No
I am not Mexican
Clearly, or what I like is that they believe that I am Palestinian or an aquatic thing, yes. If I go into some restaurants
Yes
Yes, like food from the Middle East they tell me
Eh.
and they try to speak to me in Arabic, I don't know.  They think I look more like an Indian or something hes but of course, is there discrimination or not?
Uh uh.  yes, the same, the same but not.
oh, but
I mean yes, like in this area.
ah, of course.
The same, it is more than anything with people who are Latino but they don't know much to talk but
ah, of course
because in any case there are lots of people like that who go shopping and they don't know anything of
And of course, of course.
English well and then they have to go no but the same people, you know like everywhere, they are kind of
yes. Yes.  Of course.
because there they are very discriminatory, you know that
Well here like super today that Atlanta and the whole south is like sixty-five percent black, like that.
Oh, OK
Then it is like, the fact that it is more divers like that it is like much more eh, acceptable what do I now I but at the same time to the South it is the south of the
United States it has that history of being one of the most racist places of the whole United States, in fact here.
Oh,
There was slavery and all that, then.  In any case there is a certain minority of whites who hate any ethnic group and they have their weird demonstration and all those things, but
Ah, but things like heavy, yes.
Right
the fight is strong
yes but
here no, no is like something massive no like something like quite heavy but no no like groups things no like that
right for example in the rurals parts of Georgia you could see thing like you see in the Ku Klux Klan I don't know
Oh, that is right.
yes, still
Oh, mm
and that weird things but is is well well far what is the city meaning
Eh.
is inside the city of Atlanta the place to say more civilize then this thing no
Eh
yes by luck, look what had happen, then
Oh, Oh thatbis weird.
And how do get to Idaho?
Oh I married a gringo
ah right, Idaho
yes, I got married to a gringo, I got here that way, and you?
well, my mom married a gringo
oh really?
yes.then that is why we came went to Seattle in ninety one, I was elen years then.
Mn.
but my dad stayed in Chile and because that I go and fly like this.
Oh. okay
Sure.
Mn.okay
And to
okay
interesting.
And then are you single now?
One like that, I am like we live together.
Oh, okay
then sure.
okay Ah,see and what is this called do you like it or not?
yes because I am within the city, it is more city maybe. I am from city or from the field. for example I lived in San Rafael do not know if you place yourself but
road from San Felipe to the Andes. it is like the question more more rural, and you can not imagine how
Oh.
Typical Chilean field and I loved that.
yes.
Like a village,what do I know. Oh i like being within the city  what do I know more cool, what know more things to do
hmm, I don't know, what bothers me is
Ah
then
Oh, okay
yes
It's not like
but
coming here is a super drastic change for me
yes, I can imagine
because as I was used to living in the city, and here, but anyways, there's a city here where I could find what I need, but life is
is calmer, If I may put it that way
Sure
calmer and everything, it's good, though, because, for example, there's not as much crime as in a bigger city
Sure
but it's kind of boring
yes, I can imagine
kind of
The contact is difficult too
Here. Yes, but not so much. Not so much. Even if it's small, it's not so big
Well. Oh. Hello, Juan, Marcela
Hello, how are you? my name is Juan. Marcela
yes, how are you?
listen, do not we talked the other day with..
I think so. You are in Texas and I am in North Carolina
Yes. I am so glad
yes, nice to met you
I have not forget you, we talked nicely, right?
yes
Do you have Medical insurance here? are you cover?
mhm, I am cover trough my husband.
uh uhm
and children are also covered, so we are o.k.
Oh,yes we are. we are not.
that is a problem right?
We are not covered. that is a problem because something can happen at any time
mhm, we are healthy, but you never know.
I Know, The other day I went to an office they supposedly give you something like a pension for
community people?
yes
And so the papers they asked for with the my home and proof of work. And, they finally found a pretext to to not, not give it to me because they asked me
to give information about the person who was hiring me and at that time well the person refused to give information, right?
hmm.
and and, in my case I have a son who has epilepsy.
Ah.
And then he needed some some emergency care here things that
So they didn't give you, erm, care?
uh, no. No, no. They didn't want to describe me. True. Then in the cases with him, he got ill once, yes. He got worse.
And so I had to, to go back to Mexico and for him to be seen by his doctor over there
Hmm.
And he got a prescription and I run out of the medication. Erm, I usually buy it in Mexico and
Yes, but it can be cheaper.
it is a problem with the prescription and then a friend who's a doctor had the samples and he gave me medication samples
Yes, that helps. What a thing.
Isn't it? Yes, he gave it to me. So yes, it is something we think that well there should be some kind of bit more flexible, right, so that by itself there is for the community but it is a specific type of community
Yes. Well, I think the whole system will have to fall before they do anything different. Because I think that, very difficult to fix it because there is
the cost of, the cost of everything, depends on the demand. And so if those costs go up, and up, and up
yes. yes.
Because there is more demand and people pay. And then costs go up because people ask more more money. And working people ask for more money, it is a vicious circle. An so how could it suddenly, could they create social medication?
right.
It's impposible because all this people it's like
yes, it should be
Money doesn't stop to be like a drug. They are used to a certain amount of money
Yes
And then, at one moment, they won't have it
Exactly. That's a problem, it's a circle that works with profit,it's stronger, right?
yes, of course it is
Then, the interest rates are worse
We should stop making bombs and going to war. All that money could be used
Mmm
in schools, or in a medical system, social security
Mmm, well, only with a little cut
Mmm, yes
Because, well, i don't know how it works where you live, but here, people with money are nurses and doctors, right?
well, nurses are really well paid because there are not so many, you know
Then, Well here, you can see a 30 year old woman with a really nice car
Mmm
And she is a nurse, when you find out that she is a nurse, well
Yes, like 30 dollars per hour
yes, that's similar of what they get paid. I understand that in Canada they have many medical
Mn.
Then any resident in Canada has the right to medical services. Just for been there and it really  doesn't have greater consecuences upon the economy.
No, but the difference is that they started well.
And is ..Right
yes, like in Argentina, my parents have all the medical expenses paid
Uh uh
all the medical expenses paid, they pay a little, no, but very little
yes, yes, yes. That is the other thing that one could do, to try to pay something
yes
is going to have some kind of insurance but even that is
is, is very expensive
is expensive, right? And I don't know how the prescription drugs are here, In Mexico are cheaper and also
in all the world. In all the world
There is more competition about prescription drugs there.
I was taking this medicine, my son was taking for a short time and was not available here, without the brand
Uh uh.
Eh, and then, last year we went to Argentina, went to the chemist and showed it and something which costed here more than fifty dollars
I bought there for twelve
yes, yes, yes
Twelve dollars, same brand and all.
yes
And it could have been less if you bought another brand, an unknown brand is another thing.
The same, yes.
But I don't understand.
And in Mexico's case, for example, the medication of my son comes in 5 or 6 brands.
Mm.
with similar ingredients.
Mm.
No ? yes yes, And here you don't have more than one. And second, that literature is not the best. And if you hear only about laboratories, I thought that all the North American laboratories for-
then at the hour of the competency cause here there is a monopoly
yes yes yes
Strong interest in everything, no ?
I truly do, I really do.
Mm.
That is that, according to it if so
But
according to what expertise you have to operate here. Do you know what you should do ?
yes
Because don't they get you in contact with an organization that's called the Shriners ?
Uh uh, yes.
Shriners yes.
yes, I already know.  yes, I already know.
Eh, because they help children.
Mm
Now I don't know if they specialize on a specific illness.  Or if the cover everything because maybe
Mm.
you can communicate with them and tell them, hey we have this boy and this is his condition and this is our situation.
yes.
And maybe they can help in some way.  Because the Shriners help and pay for medical care of children.  Who cannot pay.
Uh uh. Uh uh.  Well yes look, yes.
parents cannot pay.
yes I knew that.  Listen, did the time run out already or what?
what do I know, they say it is twelve minutes but their twelve minutes feel like a half hour.
Ah.  See that, I knew him and I thought it was for me.  And I was smaller without being tired and like that only
yes.  Maybe I am wrong but not finding out you see it doesn't cost anything.
Mm.  I am going to crash.
And also if you call Catholic Charities
Uh.  Uh uh.  That is it.
maybe they, maybe they have more what do I know, something that can help you in a
yes, yes it is simple because really well on the one hand the maintenance is a medication that this person who helped me with the sample says no man that
Here they treat us well, no problem. As soon as you see a community center or such and
Mm
there are  a lot of options. But knowing a little more about progress of medicine, we believe a deeper diagnostic could improve the life of our son with
with epilepsy?
Right
because it was under control but the last two years it have come apart. It has been out of control.
Mmm, Of course he is growing up and maybe that medicine is not appropriate for him and they have to give him another
and well, yes, they gave him another kind. It made him feel worse and them he had to quit and return to the basic
Mmm
Yes, he worsened.
how bad,
Yes, you know, you have to keep trying
And you should be living in a state of anxiety
yes, sometimes it's like this
and this is a lot of stress
Always
a lot of stress
you have to look up all the time
mmm, yes, yes, yes
When you know it you are always expecting it don't finally  happen. But this is a traumatic for my soon, he is an adolescent
Hmm.
It happens to him in school and then he feels very bad
Of course because on top of that it embarrasses him.  Let's see, how old is he?
yes, yes, it is a stigma.  It is a stigma.  What he has, no? then
How old is he?
Seventeen.
Oh, of course he is a teenager
Well yes, so to go back to the topic I think that he would owe a few good ones here
yes Do you also know where to find out?  In the hospitals where they teach
system of uhm
The doctors.  The medical centers where there are medical schools.
Ehm ehm
Over there many times the different departments
yes
see people that not, that can not pay in the situation like a normal, see?  Like us that can not go to a specialist doctor because it costs a lot of money
Hmm
And we don't have it.
Hmm. yes
And then they take.  And then they take note of what they give you.  And they charge you accordingly.  Something as long as it is
reasonable.  Something that you can well could uhm, do.  sometimes they don't charge you anything
MM
what month, and that, that's interesting, i had to get a test done, i have ADD
uh uh
And i was sure years ago i had it, then i just got diagnosed, i went to the hospital, the one in the university of north Carolina
uh uh
And they did not charge me anything and they did all the tests.
Oh, really?
yes.
So then, is all great, to which orientation we go now, well in fact, where I went in fact, is called University System, a Healthcare System, something like that, but
Oh, so you are only with the
So then, that's exactly where I got bounced
with the University. oh?
I said.
Oh, but what a thing.
Mm. Uh, uh. So then, if they told me no, well you have to bring us information. I had a letter showing my income and so on, right?
Mm
But, not that, we need the social security of your employer. So then, that's when they did not want to
They did not want to give you that information.
No? well not me. But, well then, now I have my social security, myself.
So then, maybe you can
yes, employed
Mm
Well, the same, me
Maybe you can now
Uh uh
Hy, how are you ? my name is Juan
Hey, very good eh, Mateo here
I'm in San Antonio, Mateo, i think we already talked, you're in Philadelphia
yes yes, and you are
ah, look, nice talking to you again
yes, what, you where what ?
listen, here is all good, what do you think about today's topic ?
no, i didn't listen, what is the topic ?
the topic is about technical equipment, like, the technology, the one you most use and depend on and yes, how do you consider that dependency
and how do you consider the issues of the technology, no ? you daily life, if it turn more of a problem than a solution, something like that
that includes the automobiles, the cars ?
it's the same as, as i was thinking, exactly that, they should include it, no ?
yes because is, you know, a machine
exactly, how's then, but, i told then that yes, the car look as the most important, no ? and i think after that at best a computer too, but no
yes, the most evident is the computer then, but, not the only one
aha, exactly but sometimes, eh, it looks more like a personal element depending on the case, could be the cars, no ? because the computer already is a tool more
than the, sometimes, we say that belongs to the institution where you are, no ? more like a job tool
ah
but a more personal tool looks like is a car, no ?
yes, and that's why, the same thing applies when you buy a car and you always use it and you have to maintain it, you always do, is part of your life
why you have to take care of the car?, you know?
yes, yes, exactly, besides I am here in Texas
ah
I feel that the car culture here is like, a culture reminicent of the horses also
you used more horses?
no? is like a horse, is something like, very, very, very personal, a close thing
yes
in our lives, they take care of them here, is as important as the, come on, as the horses at that time
yes
For some years ago, and well, so if they not say, so in our time of comunication, most important devices are those that have to do with communication, computer
eh, as permitted the information management and all that thing, no?
yes, because, in Texas there yes, but only there
but
you need the car, you know?, to work
yes
so
exactly and here the working people have like as in those days, a mule. no?, they need one, a pick up, truck pick
ah? yes, yes
pick up truck, no?
uh
and the computers, well, since practically there is there is television, telephone and computers in all homes, no? but but like there are other dimensions no? about the technological question, then the car seems to be
of the most important
yes, but,, the questions about the topic where which ones
oh, what )) what technical question, technological is more important in your life?  that is what we are discussing right now if it would have to be the car or if it would have to be the computer, what do you think?
well, for me it would be more my computer and my cell phone
aha, exactly
because you know? because I have my cell phone and I am always with it
aha
and, well I have gotten used to having a cell phone, you know?
aha
in before, I did not have a cell phone until I was about twenty years old, but now that to, that live in Philadelphia in the city and that I am not always at the house fo-
I'm not always returning to the house for, you know?  see my messages
yes, yes
well I am always, always, I always have my cell phone
you have your cell phone
I think that it is very is like surprising that almost everybody has a cell phone, here in the United States
, yes look that yes, that is very important what you have just said, a long time ago when I worked I had a kind of work in which the computer was the most important, no?
yes
and well, the messages were on the computer, I was always on the internet, the emails more than the phone, neither cell phone nor anything no?
yes
the computer was the most important
but now
but now, with the kind of work that I'm doing the car is the most important. The computer because the car is what lets you re- th- the kind of work that I'm doing is more
more physical, right? Then the car becomes the ins- the more important device and the computer, well, is a second level, even though it's also very important, right?
but well it is good for the kind of work
good for I think, how good, you and, you were in Texas and obviously you know, there there's more, uh, how do you say it? I understand you have more like farms and everything there, you know?
much more space
yes, yes
that in the, in the city having a car can be an inconvenience, too.
Yeah, yes it is.
because you always have to try to park and you have to pay a lot to park and the gas station isn't close and, I don't know, it's
It's more of a problem than a tor- than, than a help, but obviously, you know?
Oh, yeah?
It's better to have a car, a- I think.
Yeah, uh, yeah, no, well, here, because the distances that you have to cover for work, the car is fundamental.
Aha, of course.
But yeah in, in the city I think that yeah, the most impor- and depending on the work too, well, uh, it could be the computer, right? Then
the, the other question or, or the communication devices, right? Like you said, the cell phone and
Aha.
And that, uh, and the other question is if you consider that those technologies turn into more of a problem than, than in
alright, what kind of problems he could have ? like you just said, the only problems with the car could come from parking
aha
no ?, here in Texas we dont't, especially where i am, have that problem with the parking, lots of open spaces, didn't come up
we say, those problems over here, but anyway, don't know, what do you think, more than anything i would say, related to cars, there isn't any overall big issue with them at least
we could consider an issue the interest created around car industry and how they usually seem to affect the development of the technology of
transportation, no ?, for example
aha, but, don't you think is a bit magnificent the change happened in like sixty years ?
yes
ah, and if we look 75 years in the past there wasn't even a bus, but today almost all people have it
yes yes, but, yes
and the same thing with pc's they have, machines that would not see the market at least for 10 years because
for
the are very advanced and they will
yes
charge their costs, do you get me ?, i don't think i explain very good
exactly yes, like they say too, with the auto industry right ? if they advanced technologically like the electronic one the best car would transport us with
100 km with only 1 liter of gasoline
aha
right ? and instead of costing you, say, 20.000 dollars, would cost you 2000
yes
if that were the case, no? but, as technology, in this case the industry, has its interests then no, like it doesn't move forward, no? you see what they're saying now with the hybrids
that no, a lot of them say that they're not affordable that in reality it's only a matter of image that companies manage and when it's time to see the tables of, of performance
of the hybrid cars well I thought they would be much more efficient I think that what they have accomplished on efficiency is minimal
yes
no? no, it doesn't seem to me that they have a real a real, this that it's really a very important change like technological given the efficiency that
yes, that was an important change
what?
you don't think it is an important change, or?
no, I don't think that it is so important every time that the efficiency they demonstrate isn't radically different to the one the other cars have is very little, no? you see, I say
ah
one, to, according to the tables an economical car drives you it can be thirty-six miles per gallon
uh huh
and a hybrid can drive you fifty
ah no, ah yes sure, sure that, there are cars there now like the, the Ford
uh, well
the pickup well not the pick up trucks because they're changing them so that they're more efficient, you know?
uh huh
but, but the expedition and those enormous cars and that they spend, you know? can only go like twenty miles, eighteen miles per gallon something like that, that is an enormous expense
yes exactly and and of course, and but, at the same time for example with these autos of um, there are some small cars that give you almost the same performance as the hybrids, and they're not hybrids, no?
by, small cars, new ones that aren't in the North American market, that are in the European or Latin American market where they have to be much more efficient
ah, yes
and smaller, no? so if we compare the costs of a hybrid against a small European car, or or from Iso which circulate in latinamerica well then
n- it turns out to be much more expensive to have a car at what is the initial cost and for what is going to be saved in gasoline, ends
being less to what an auto has, a good economic car, no?
and, why is it that
European
why is it that the United States is one of the only nations that has this, that, you have these enormous autos only here, you know?
yes, it's, yes
over there in other countries they all have small cars that well, different, different culture, you know? but
yes I, as a matter of fact, years ago that was the problem with oil, in the eighties or something like that, I don't remember
ah, uh huh
I thought that there was going to be a change in the culture, because they started to, to develop smaller cars here in the United States.
yes, but
I though well, there will be a change in the culture, but that was only for the moment, no?, it seems because it has some enormous cars, they continue like
I am Ana Maria.
Oh Faviola, Hi.
Hi Faviola
How are you?
Good and you, How is the weather over there in your house?
Very good, with some sun or with some coldness.
Some sun and some coldness, ah.
Cold
Over here it's ugly, we are too cold. What do you think of the movies? Have you already talked about this topic?
Yes
Me too, I have gotten this topic before.
No i haven't gotten this topic and I had to talk about eh, specifically the person when I got talked to me about violence.
mhm
that they did not like the idea of going to see a movie. I told them, a world that is a world has violence.
mhm
They have always had, and I have the experience to teach the kids with pure peace and love in the television or, or of the world and then when they confront the world realize that it's the school.
They find that, the kids hit him, that they didn't know how to defend above all things when you have kids of your own.
aja
then uhm, I find that I was right in the classification they have, I think it's the responsibility of the adults, until when the kids can see television
I am in agreement, that the respons-the maximum responsibility is of the parents.
They're doing their job those on the movies, and
They're gaining their cash, what's their job,
it's their business, you
doing their business, yeah
yeah now if you want it, take it, if you want to see it, or not is not their responsibility anymore, they se
of, yeah
that sells
yeah
and that's what they do, it's not their fault, the buyer is at fault
yes, because in the end he likes the product, that's why
yes
with you it's final responsibility, whether it's violence, sex, whatever there is to protect a, a child. the final responsibility it's for the parents, even with a qualification system in place.
because if there's for example a movie qualified as PG 13
yes
and you have a minor of that age and you let him see the movie, it's your responsibility.
yes
it's because you let him and you thought it could be, isn't it?
exactly
entonces why me the, the, the association, or, or, or whatever that puts the, uh that puts the qualifications already has it, then
i think yeah, look we think more or less the same on that Faviola because, in the end the responsibility of nurtering and taking care and what you want him to see and what not
your children or your family. and, your mother or your husband as a mother.
mmm I also believed that I am totally agree and that, normally have access to children when parents are televicion outside.accurate
exact
children are alone.
mmm
and there is not enseñarlle or the pope to tell you, this should not see this, if you see
or go to a sleepover you do not know either
not clear because you have no idea
if you go to a sleepover and they put a movie, watch a movie or no control in that house or whatever.
not know.
exactly.
I think the important thing is to give children one respect these, indicates whether a given good principles at home. one as a family or teaches, things
shure
actually I do not like or do not like it. you see it or not prepared, or just going to get far.
that, because, as they say, you can not have in a glass box.
not, and also
leaves, exposed or exposed
if not, moreover, that when children reach an age. my son was fifteen, sixteen seventeen years, and I said do not worry, because you did the best I could do.
mmm
ah, you descend from twenty-five genes and the rest is education and decision, my decision in my life.
Look, with that
Sure, I learned then, oh wait, no, eh, oh, I was
mm
My cellphone was ringing. Okay, okay, let me answer.
okay
eh, don't hang up because we have to speak for twelve minutes.
yes
I'm just going to go turn it off.
okay ah
So, about the people, I think the movies that I love to watch are the horror movies.
I see
But sometimes, the ones that are scary to me, I'm an adult.
You get scared, you get scared
they are scary but I'm going to find out the horror movies.
I see, but you are responsible for watching them, you scare yourself
yes
I see, well I don't like them so I don't watch them, I don't watch any of them. That's my decision, I could since I have the age to watch them, but if it's too violent I don't watch them.
yes, that's why, that's why I respect the fact that my son said ones, that it's a fifty percent responsibility
Yes
of each person, the person and then you did the best you could, but then kids grow up and before they are eighteen years old, the
some are more mature than the norm
yes
And begin to see the R movies
mmh
at fourteen or fifteen and the PG thirteen are been seen by eleven or twelve years old kids.
yeah, yes
and sometimes even the littlest ones. Sometimes the littlest ones because I remember of a friend of Jenny that watched them, she sees Harry Potter and is
yes, thirteen yes
PG thriteen, PG fourteen and then I say, Jenny doesn´t like it, she gets scared.
Yeah
She gets scared by the monsters and all that stuff
yes
But I agree that most of it is the criteria that you give to them, and at the end take care of them if you don´t want them to watch television when they are alone
yes because, because
Don´t let them alone with the TV.
But think that you cannot control them.
But it is just television
that´s what I say, you can control them, you cannot see this movie because of this or that. Because you lack of maturity or whatever we want to tell them, isn´t that true?
You should have a formed criteria to go and see a movie.
yes that is why I say it doesn´t have a purpose to say, you cannot see that, not. Because there will be a time when they go to a friend´s house
uh huh, in the same school it shows movies to them.
Oh the same school, but the same school is a little more supervised because that is another thing. Because it goes, it goes with a purpose.
They show him documentaries.
But what I fear more is when he goes to friends' house. And they have sometimes the television right there in the room, that they use it so much, or the computer or whatever.
And they have access to information without the parents, no, nor the parents have any idea. And they are in the room the parents think that they are listening to music or whatever
At best they are looking at something inappropriate then. That's why I say, or that is that which happens, it's that if my daughter or my son or whatever,
faces that situation he has to learn to value, and to learn to respond to that, That is what I say, or rather trying, trying to give them the values of the house.
To follow like like Superman the little child to go out the window and is killed.
me, of course, because you know that they are still not prepared.
that they want to fly. No, you I want to ask you a question.
uh huh
eh, you read the rules that there are in this, telephone game
yes Okay
um I was asking myself, ah, how is this? are you preparing for Christmas now?
yes, yes, yes now I am preparing now I am buying the gifts for the family. But now I am with all, with other things in mind.
the coming birthday no.
yes but, I am preparing, buying presents for the family at least my nephews. I have those ready, now we have bought the presents, then the big people remain no more.
Buy the big people something, an intention, anyway the majority of the presents I'm going to make them.
That's what I was going to tell you
I'm going to cook. yes ah
cook and sew. Sew that which you did, that which you gave to me.
yes and also for some children yes also
No that of the table.
yes, yes also, but I don't have time yet I have to wait til the middle, til the last week of December to do it.
Oh, because you are
Because I have no time before then.
That's pretty.
yes, so that's what I'm going to do also. That's why I'm going to make some gifts, but for example, Andreita who's birthday is soon.
Two days before Miranda.
Andreita's birthday is coming up, too. Oh, three
yes is the twenty fifth or twenty four, I don't remember.
Oh, yes but I remember that it was like three days.
Three days then from the twenty four. So, I have her gift, I bought her the same thing I bought Miranda, So, eh
What did you buy Miranda?
For the, one of those screens that you draw and then you erase.
Ay how cute
Because she likes it, she's seen it and she likes, she makes lines and then she erases them- the I'm not going to give it to them yet because they are too small and they put them in the mouth.
But in the meantime the pencil and screen yes.
Ay how nice
But yes because little things like that.
how exciting.
Of course, you see, then.  These things like these it is a pleasure to do them, then I bought the same for Andreita.  And with that already,
And do you know who else has a birthday.
OK who
The same date
who?
that I remember when I was there
My father-in-law, that
Your father-in-law, yes
yes it is true, who?
he, he, Juan Luis Sandra's youngest son.
Oh yes OK
Also the twenty- the twenty-ninth.  Also I remember, that about the same date, I remember that they were all on the same date.
I don't remember about him having one on I didn't know at least.
No, you went to Carlistos' birthday.  And, the girl's.
I have not gone to any birthday at Sandra's house.  I went to just one, I don't remember, really.
No you went once you went to Chile and left the gift, which was for the birthday,
Eh, it was in April, well, when I went to Chile it was in April.
OK, that was another birthday, she has three.
and I left there the, yes, I left the present there
yes, for a nephew of hers that came after.
of course he came, yes, yes, she told me that she had given it to her, yes. But, what you call it, no
No, but Sandra will not have birthday, she will not have a party this year.
no, no okay
No, I mean just for the family only, because they will buy something better for the baby and
yes, it's true
The fact is that she does parties that are too big, then
she spends too much, yes
too much, she spends too much in that, and  she can't buy the baby the things that
what they really want, exactly
they, of course, have to decide between one thing of the other.  So this year, decided, the baby decided that only the family
And to have a more special present
Of course, to have a preset more,
Juan, Juan is the oldest or the youngest
The youngest of all.
oh, yes, yeah,
and, and says I do not want clothes.
Poor him.
I do not want book, I just want toys.
Carolina
Tamara
Tamara, how are you?
yes, and you?
Fine, fine. Where are you?
I'm in the state of Washington, in Seattle
wow, I'm in Los Angeles
Ah, yes
yes, it's amazing, just
yes
Right now I was making a call and suddenly I, I mean I didn't think that today Sunday  I was half- more asleep than awake, and I, Oh my God!
yes, yes, they got me off base. But you've already been doing this for some time?
yes, this is, I think, my 23th call
wow, you're almost ready, I'm right in the middle, this is my 10th
yes, and this is the second time I do this service for them
Oh, okay, okay, yes, because casually I got a mail that they will accept people who'll do again the, eh, participate, because at first you could participate only once
yes
no, you got that same mail ,right? I mean, apparently this will keep going. That's what I got from the mail they sent
yes, I
More like, yeah, tell me
Then, what do you think about what they show in the movies the?
Tell me? Well i am going to tell you honestly, it has been more than a year since we stopped watching movies movies in regular movie theaters and we started at the theater
little conventional
OK
we started at the theater, for example in the case of theater, no, the same one as in tv.  Now we watch documentary type movies...hum...with different kind of messages then
OK
watch movies that are in hum how is this called? the movie festivals, here as an example recently ended the International Latin American Movie Festival
hum if he was
yeah
Hello
no, i am not at my computer, i am sorry
oh OK approximately a month or less than a month because as I tell you it has a been a long time since we decided that we were not going to keep wasting our time
time, in the majority of cases they are really movies with a quite silly and absurd content, and well we took the decision that no, we did not want to waste more time and money
OK
eh watching one type of movies that really did not take anywhere
yes because there are plenty of movies like that, i have noticed
yes
yes i like hum here where i live there were some of these oh like Hollywood Video or Blockbuster but it was like
smaller
OK
it was then they had movies like those they are talking about ah documentaries and like that but they closed it because like the stores these big ones are always here people don't want to go to that,
Of course
but those are the best, as you find movies I like yes, my husband is an American but he also likes international movies, movies that have more
more important things to say
Exactly, Exactly
Once in a while, as I have small children sometimes they want to watch some movies and we take them but usually we don't, we have. Before we went like two or three times a month to the movies
aha
but now it has shortened, so it is once or twice every two months
OK.  The same we we usted to go about once a month but we used to go frequently, lots, lots and one good day we saw a movie but so s-
tupid, so dumb that I was bothered to be in the movie theatre, I well, and what are we doing here?  What waste of time is this?
No, no, no, and really suddenly we started to receive information about other kinds of movies and well we switched completely to that; furthermore right now we are in one
in one of those kicks, that we are even kind of intellectual now but it is that, it is because actually it kind of got to that point, where you feel that:
What are you doing no?  I mean to see that, honestly I rather go to sleep or I'd rather do something else instead of of, I don't tell you all movies, there are some that have a
a very different content, that it is worth watching them but in the end I have felt that they are making movies, like just for making them
aha exactly.
aha, like well we have to make ten movies; we are going to make ten movies but it doesn't matter, how? or when? however it comes out, without
care ase we say.  Where are you from?
I am from Panama
Ah, OK I am from Venezuela.
Oh OK
Right, yes
in, then it is true, is true
We say in that way to the "Macha" no, like well, yes do movies like you want but yes released some good released and others, if they don't be released don't be released but
Honestly not. And the same is happening with the TV right now. We had cable and now just a matter of a month ago we canceled it because not, no I don't know suddenly as
we was against that we realized that was too much media manipulation they only show the news that are good for them they hide the truth
Oh then that is talking about the news and about the movies then yes sure a movie really very good very good
but then they show it again and show it again and show it again. Oh my God! What is this? we are paying for this then it is like a discomfort, right now we have a discomfort with
with the media we are in that way reluctant, yes yes.
yes it is true what you say. I here, my husband and I, we watch the news
I think right
Because every time you watch something or they show something so stupid
exactly
or you have or they exaggerate too much
Exactly
Because, when I was, we were in Panama before Noriega left Panama
Oh imagine
And were we there and My husband you know? that white guy, white paper compare with my dad is black and my mom is white then I am more black than my dad, so
when we went out you knew that he was an American.
Logic, logic
We  both got into, we got into where we had to go, he had to go to the work to the base and I had to go with him or something like
sure
and we would get home and turn on the television and we would watch some news about Panama, I would watch the
Hey, weren't we there this morning? I don't remember seeing anything about it there
exactly
and the next day, same happened and I said, "oh, ex-agent! I believe they were showing stuff that happened last week and overreacting
Exact-
since then, he doesn't want to believe the things that are shown in the television
Exactly
the news, nothing, that's what I always tell my children, don't believe everything that is said on television.
Exactly
Because it's not true, and that
You see, coincidentally they showed a picture called The... It was something like "Defending Panama"
aha
That was exactly the problem with Noriega and so we watched the documentary and I was shocked because I had never imagined that what happened there was so sad and so
ugly, everything that happened
They spoke of a man whose head was cut off.
and oh yeah
I don't remember
I can't remember but I think that happened the night of the bombings and lots of people died there, even these past few days they showed a
a summary of the President's visit
aha!
He was around there and people were protesting asking why the  current President did nothing so the victims of that sector would be remembered.
I think it was called "Los de Richos" the Chinese sector that practically the whole town disappeared and I
oh from "Churillo"
ah Del Chorrillo, exactly
Yes that's where it was, the part of the police force was there
Yes. But just like you say it seems that happens the same way in Venezuela with the current President. There are things happening that you know aren't actually happening
that already happened long time a go; so they put them here in Venezuela as if they were happening and what not. Its crazy, the other day I wrote to one reporter
from Univision. Telling them not to be so shameless, asking them to not report things that aren't true, people first say hey! that President
and what not, that's a crazy one what they are doing is distorting the information in a way that they make him seem as a monster, a
dictator, and we have gone through Four Elections and Four Referendums, so it cannot get any more democratic than that. But it's his personality,
He's got a personality that is uncommon, and people don't know how to accept that. So even him is the first on criticize everhing
that's right
and well, I don't know if you've heard him
No, no cause like i was saying I don't really pay attention to the news,
Of course, look, there's an internet page were you can watch TV from all countries including of course Panama its called
Te ve Cuatro, like TV four all
-TV
four all
Yes, theater.
Four is a number four
aha
TV Number four all
TV or TV for all
exactly, exactly there you go
with
is dot com yes
Okay
There you can see the schedule of all the channels, all the channels in the world, of course you also have Panama and Venezuela. And there now I watch, Venezuelan TV
But I specifically watch the government chanel, the national chanel. Because the other channels belong to the opposition, then of course it is a litle bit more of the same
but I like to watch and to see the stupid things that they are saying
Okay
Then I compare it and since i have this internet page now i don't have to turn on the TV.  Now we are there but stuck to the internet watching the ___ channels
of the whole world a little like to compare you see, that is what is going on and even what we are doing as well with the radion we are listening to community, radio that you feel that it i- you
you are really saying the truth or at least the other face of the coin let's not say that it is the truth One hundred per Cent because sometimes it is not
that is it is not that I don't know, but that one can not say either that all of the ones that say the other it is not but
aha
darn they really do manipulate things too much.
yes
I don't know if you
Pardon?
you got one  I don't know if you saw here a movie that was called Auto fox
No, maybe but I do not recall
That is a documentary that they worked at Fox New
hmm
and well practically they would force them to say what was not true and then they decided to resign to the channel and aside from resigning all of them got together and started to do like a protest to a level
well on the level of, of ehm locally to tell the world what was going on over there inside Fox News.  It is very interesting, it was called something like
"Fox Workers that are Outside"
some
Something like that like out on the outside
aha
and Fox of Fox News
My name is
Hello my name is Fernanda
Hello Fernanda, How are you? My name is Claudia.
How are you?
Where are you talking?. Well. Where are you talking from?
from Washington
ah, Which one of them two?
Washington, DC
ah, yes because, then, I think there are two, or not?
yes, Washington State
ah, I see and the other one
And, where are you?
yes, I´m here in Idaho State, I don´t know if you know it.
yes, yes, yes of course yes
yes,but that thing about the movies, the fact is than in my point of view, I don´t agree with them because after all
they don´t classify them very well. Ah, for example, sometimes they say is PG and later you see that movie and it really
has many dirty words and porn. Sometimes another one PG thirteen is more quiet
and doesn´t have such many things like nudity and dirty words. The true is that to me, those classifications sometimes are like they don´t
know, the people who criticize those movies don´t know how to grade them or, I don´t know your point of view.
yes, the true is that I don´t know to much about movies because
aha
let's say, I don't have children or anything like that, so I almost never realize
aha
what, what classification.
aha
But I think that most television shows, let's say if you watch during the day time is when many times children are at home
aha
those are things that are not appropriate for most of them.
yes
And I think hat eh Americans have, no- like that the mo- moral standards have gone down, you get me? so
yes
now many things are like normal that that I think shouldn't be.
yes, yes it's true because, eh, and it's true because eh, once, well I don't have cable I have, the regular channels, the ones you watch
aha
but for example, I once had for, for a while cable and sometimes it was, well, why do they like it? ten in the morning, eleven, and well y don't like to keep changing channels
to keep on choosing my program that I'm going to watch in that ra- at that time
mhm
and sometimes the show movies that really, uf. A ten year old or a nine year old kid was at home and he was watching that, he was changing channels at the same time as I was and
he stopped on that channel, there things that were very, very much for adults.
sure
So I said, uf, I said, I thought about the kids, I said, well, I'm I'm married, I've been married for three years, I've got a kid who is almost two years old
okay
my son is going to grow up and this is just going to get worse. So,
sure and
imagine, what kind of cartoons are they going to watch them, I remember that I was once watching the television, you see, in Mexico, I'm from Mexico City
mhm
It was around ten in the evening, ten PM. So, I turned on the TV, I had cable there, the cable TV
the channel her it's number sixteen, so I was watching a cartoon in English because they show some in English during the evenings, some are in Spanish too
so a cartoon in English was being aired so I started watching and my mom was there with me, she was all calm because I was watching a cartoon
So, the cartoons started to get naked
ah
and the guy was doing stuff to two other cartoons. It was a cartoon! Imagine that, ten o'clock in the evening, and my mom said
what's that!
she turned the television off and she had to explain it to me because she was surprised, I mean, shocked because I was watching a regular cartoon channel.
So, I mean, I don't, not even cartoons are safe now.
and that could happen to any child watching television.
Cartoons are like that sometimes.
And you can't be with your kid all the time, you can't jump and try to see what he's watching, you have to trust that, at least during the day
yes
the shows are not going to include nudity or bad words.
yes, yes it's true. But really it's not cartoons sorry, Japanese cartoons are the ones that have the most classification eh. In Mexico eh,
eh, tr- in Cablevision and Multivision, that would be the same as cable here so- ah, over there in Mexico, they don't have as many restrictions. For example, in regular television, with regular channels
they have like more, more restrictions. Eh not so much in the other cables and, for example, in, in teles, for example, a regular ch- channel for kids
in television like that, any channel, the, channel, for example channel five that it's for cartoons
yes
for example, after ten at night, eleven and you can watch TV and they don't show such ugly programs. Well
in the District of Mexico, mhm
before, in Mexico. But for example, if you are watching a cable channel you run the risk that the cartoon may be something that sometimes is some
pornographic thing or more nudity
I p- yes, I pi- look, I am Colombian and I think that in Colombia neith-
So, mm aha
television is much better than here in that sense.
aha
because, they c- can show, let's say at ten in the evening and the programs they show are never so, you don't don't run the risk, no? that they would be so bad like here. Here
aja
what's more, here when it's not e- even ten or at any other time you run the risk of seeing anything
yes, yes, it's true lo- the other, well eh, I was with a neighbor, imagine I was with a neighbor, it was twelve, twelve thirty in the afternoon.
So her boy was watching eh, the a cartoon channel and then the girl thought about changing the channel and em- and it was another channel that was programmed for them, for children.
Well, there was a show there was, where there was a, a girl that had adventures of a girl that was that, that in a hospital
and suddenly it happened right there in the hospital and they were showing how, how her mom was giving birth to her little brother.
ah yes?
Yeah, but you can tell i took and told him at her mother and she said ah,no there is no problem is a channel of
of of cartoons,of,of that they play programs and sincerely i was i was they did not leave much to the imagination. it was really a pose of well it was an operating room where the lady was having a baby.
what horror.
they were they were six years
yes
Because they are twins, have eh the two had six years. and their mon was letting them watch that. well each each parent can let them see
what they want. but sinceraly a m-do not want to explain to my kids too much for the moment,sincerly I watch more what they see,
well you see,no? in that aspect,but uf.
yes, imagine when lets say there are babysitters and things like that that have no center and you are not even home to see.
mm aja
you do not know what they see.that they go to their friends for whatever.
yes no
I think
yes is of those, really those rating they pass Yn-yn-n-y primary for the televison, the truth already already n-
they do not leave a thing to imagination,they show you.
yes
Now at whatever,whatever time of the day you see one of those telenovelas, I do not like to watch telenovelas but,see
Many mo-mon is home and has young children three,four years five or more they are at home and they see they are watching their telenovela
And always est-they show scenes were they are the , a couple they are there having relations
Mhm
During the day, why do they put on so-operas, from six am until it gets dark.
right
And they're like that, so then we stop having an imagination.
Not, me
then, the programs are classified, so it would be normal to see a pornographic on TV in the middle of day.
And the parents would think its something normal.
exactly
And i think that if the parents talked to that TV station and told them to put away unacceptable programs, or to put privacy on some scenes, from those kind of scenes.
I think it will go down a little, but i don't know anymore, its now normal when parents and kids watch something like that together.
they don't care, mhm
what are they teaching them. I don't like those classification things, and the producers dont really care, i think its only convenient to them, because,
If a movie has a sexual scene, or bad words people buy it, or people watch it and even laugh about it.
Or sometimes it even gets their attention because there's a strong scene, so those things actually help the,
producers to sell.
sometimes, and
so, no, to be honest, the only kid of movies i actually like are the Disney ones,
I like kids movies.
yeah, yeah, yeah
Even though, I'm already tired of them, but still like them, I have a Disney movie here, but i honestly just don't like movies.
hardcore movies that, that have a lot of sex and all that because I repeat it to you, I am going to have children so I would not be
and at least if they are going to play a movie, well that at least it is a decent movie. That does not have so many things.
sure, sure
As the things are going, even the Disney ones may have pornography in a while, ¿right? then
Yes, one does not know how they will change
No, no, so then already, the truth is that, this is truly reaching too far already, you turn the TV on and see a tv spot
about women pads and it appears well until almost, they are going to explain how, soon they will display a naked movie and are going to
show there how she is placing the pad on
exactly
Because sometimes they even draw it for you. I do not know if you have seen such commercials that uf. They do not scare you because you are already grown up ¿right? but
if a little boy or girl is watching them and you say, it the mom is there and can answer all is right, and if it is the friend who is there
and she or he answers, he/she can explain him/her the wrong info so,
and one gets accustomed ¿do you understand? so to speak
then, yes
like I sometimes see and one does not realize how things have changed.
Good night my name is Mariza de Philadelphia
Hello Hello my name is Juan are you Marisol.
Mariza. Mariza.
Perphaphs that is - Mariza, we talked like in a few days I think.
Oh, yes, maybe so.
Could be, I am in San Antonio, Texas.
In San Antonio, yes.
OK well the subject today is, the issue with religion, right.
Yes, a very complicated subject and very controversial.
Well Exactly, like the need of religion is something, something we all have, I suppose.
mhm
And that like every other need, the institutions are based of
Yes,
Give an answer. And end up being like a form of control, right.
Ahh, yes in reality every nowadays in this country. Eh, in the United States there is also a lot, a lot of problems with religion, that is mixed of with politics and a lot of right-wing people that are the ones that want to have control.
they try to control the country based on their religion also, and it could be a positive or a negative for a lot of people, well the help like praying or believing in something, it helps them, etc.
Otherwise, Christianity is the most powerful religion in the world and they are the ones who most, who have more control to have an influence to politics, to countries.
Yes look that in this case, for example here where I live, I once went to church.
mhm
What, they represented a whole project, ideology, but plain and simple, they are the most conservative groups in the United States, right.
mhm, yes
So they exercised a power very, well very direct, very clear, trying to influence people there in the church.
yes
In the sermon, above all it very much called my attention against the public school.
mhm
directly against the public school and they prayed so that God would deliver us from the public school one day.
really?
Because yes,
ah, ah, no
And against the theory, of that they try to see the theory of evolution, no.
So, that's what I had heard, yes.
No, terrible, they said, Why this harassment of teachers that teach the bible to explain the creation of the world?
Exactly, yes, there are many problems, yes.
May the train take me, I say, well, that, with all reason, no the bible doesn't make an explanation of the world.
No, each one can believe whatever they want, what happens is that they try to im- impose their belief for everyone and that the bible be, that they are the ones that think
Exactly, those are fundamentalism, no.
Yes fundamentalism, yes, yes, yes from the right. But it's also the country is, eh, the power is in the hands of the party, that all from the president to all the ones that are into in is, in the White House are all right wing conservatives.
whites from, eh, Christians and those are the ones that people with power in this country, the ones that own companies, everyone is, the same, that they are many conservative fundamentalist people from the right that want to take out the law
The right to abort, the right to, for example like another question was about homosexuality, gay marriage, the right to believe in the
yes, more scientific no, no, One should not only believe in what they say, they say God created man and woman, but also give the option for kids to believe,
that it was Charles Darwin the theory of evolution. And
yes
And is very complicated also, the other questions was about homosexuality, yes, yes If we were all the same or believed the same thing, these problems wouldn't exist, asked.
But
Well I think that maybe, the more alike we are, the more problems, no.
yes
In that sense, the differences help to compliment.
Of course, I, I don't have any,
The topic, the topic of homosexuality is very controversial.
mm
But at any given moment,is like, like the tolerance the phenomenon of homosexuality should be something, that, that we should be well informed on, me personally for example I used to think before that,
it could be regarded as a deviation, homosexuality, but lately I've read that it's also a question of genetics.
Yes I, am convinced that is that because I know many people that are,
No
eh, well homosexuals, or lesbians and, I'm very informed and then that's why always I don't know why. Since I was, since I was a girl well,
Like I used to accept people because, I didn't think they were better or worse for being homosexuals and every one has a right to, I don't know, to get married, to
Well yes,
to be with whoever they want. Its' the same whether is a man or a woman, I don't care and I think they have the same rights because they are citizens just the same, and they pay their own taxes.
yes
They deserve the right to marry, to live with whomever.
Yes yes I agree with you, exactly I think that, they have all the rights, so we can have any other kind of people And in this case with the rights concerning the marriage.
Because many people think about the homosexuality like a very perverted thing and they don't have the right to get married, not when is a situations when actually the marriage is an agreement.
mhm
between two persons that decide to do something in common.
Of course, but the the church disagrees.
No,
It thinks that is an abomination because the marriage is defined as the union between a man and a woman and believe, and the, and people and the devout fundamentalist Christians like I used to say before see that like an abomination, and they are so stubborn they don't understand that.
Maybe that was before, the traditional way of thinking in the past but now times are changing and each one so is, the same as before, homosexuality has always existed , since the human being beginning what happen is that before was a way and right now so,
it goes, I don't know things are more liberal nowadays, let's say people people are not afraid of say anymore, so I am homosexual, or I am gay or I am  whatever
That's the problem. That have the church has a problem, but it can't do anything becaus
Yes
People are accepting the fact that people, yes look he is homosexual, yes and is okay. very good.
Of course Yes there is some that is very extreme about, eh, the family and the marriage, the church institute and the God blessing to the marriage and stuff when actually.
the church and religion is a form of institution, it is the same as the school, has
Of course.
first the need of change and find new, new ways to learn the things of the life.
yes
of the society and the individuals, no.
Yes the re- the religion would have to be something personal, not something mixed with politics everyone can, what, what you think, what you believe belongs to anyone, it has not to because is,
oh, look because you don't think the same that I think, you're not like I am, so, about how are blamed because they are not equal, and it not that, everyone can think whatever wants, believe in anyone or anything wants, does not have,
for Christians, because they talk badly about Muslims because they say they are radicals, or talk poorly about, about atheists because they don't believe in God and call them heretics, or,
But I don't know
aha
That is not very Christian to be like that, you have to accept people as they are, and each one who believes or has his or her religion, but that is the problem with fundamentalists, they don't accept differences.
Yes well, but in that case, to accept differences seems to be something that has to do with a matter of humanity, no.
mm
Like it is a paradox not to be able to accept the difference they think but, aha
What happens is that yes, It is that in this country when children are, those families, the Christian families that, right-wing, let's say that they raise their children in such a way that, since they are very young they teach them they have to be like that, and like that, and like that, then,
When they are older and they meet people who are different then they tell them, no, that is not that, because they taught me it is like this, and like this, and like this and it has to be
you know that they are very, radical, no, they don't accept differences because they were rased in a way that their parents taught them, hten.
yes
I for example, had the good fortune of traveling a lot of meeting people from many races, many cultures, then I am open to everything.
aha
And that is why when I see a person who is not, I immediately know it, just looking at them I say, this person, is not going to accept because I am not like her, I am not, I don't think the same, I don't see myself the same.
But it is that there are kinds there are people of all kinds and, and well there must be radical Christians there must be all kinds, but I believe that yes, it does influence the country a lot, the religion, yes
Eh, yes, it influences a lot, what surprises me the most in this case,
yes
In this country, that it is so fundamental, no
Yes I they are
With the churches, there is a good percentage of fundamentalists even in the discurse of the very president there is fundamentalism,
Sure, yes, yes, yes
not there,
The message is pretty clear, it's been five years with this government and when Bill Clinton was in the government, well, he was not that, he was pretty open, let's say, sure, he was leftist, more open, a more open person.
he would understand people's problems and this government, lets say, they are religious Christians from the right, I mean, the ones that
are taking the decisions of how things are done in this country, that's why there's so many controversy regarding marriages. It's also like that in the Supreme Court, with the, judges, they want them to be right-wing, they want them to be religious, they
don't care whether they are Catholics, they just want that they, they want to eliminate the right to abortion and things like that, it's ridiculous, at this stage in the century.
aha
They want, they want us to go back, to go back instead of moving forward, they want things that were done thirty or forty  years ago, that can't happen!
But, that's how we are now.
aha, do you, do you  follow any particular religion?
My family is from Spain so we are Catholics, let's say, when you are born you get baptized, then there's the First Communion and all that, well I got married in the church too.
Sure.
I believe, well, i have my beliefs, but i not attend to the church, to every Sunday service, neither practice, i am, i believe
but let's say i do it at my own way, let's say that the faith i have with me, i don't
yes
neither, neither i am, i mean i am very open i mean it's contradictory I'm quite believer, i'm catholic, but i'm not you know, i'm not funda- nothing
yes It happens the same to me and when I have some closeness with the Catholic Church, it is almost temporal because They are so hey where is a sense of integration, of community in here
created interest in everyone seems
yes, yes, yes there is lot of economic interest, yes
no, then
That's the problem, it's at first sight that they are not interested in the church members, they are interested in the money, and
yes
And also neither they seem to be quite believers, there had been a lot of cases of, child abuses and things like that, of child abuses
That are often heard, so one ask himself how this can be possible. That a, a priest do this to a child and, There is much controversy regarding this
yes
But, Let's say that faith, is one himself, i don't know  what each one is free to believe whatever wants and, practice it, but respecting those who are not equal
yeah
Because there are a lot of religions and what's happen is that christian religion is the most plenty in all the world, it's the most, the one who has power over everything
Therefore in the world that we living in, at this side of the world no, because i believe not anymore not even the Christians are mayority, i believe there are more Muslims than christians
Yes but they don't have too much economic power, that's the problem
mhm
hi, good evening.
yes, good evening.
good evening, my name is caroline.
oh, how are you carolina? do you talk to Alex
what alex?
from los Angeles
oh well, I'm from new york

ha
i am from los angeles,
oh okay, nice to meet you
nice to meet you
well, we got this night, the technical devices.
where are you from?
I'm from peru.
oh okay,
and you?
um, i am from colombia,
colombian?
mhm
Oh, but you talk like a Mexican.
Because here we speak Mexican Spanish.
Aha
Because of that.
Ah, OK, of course.
You catch the, you catch the accent from where you live.
Oh.
With the, when I lived in Spain I caught the a-, the Spanish accent
Mmmh.
When I lived in Colombia, I caught the Colombian Spanish. From Bogota, especially.
Mm. Mmh.
Now it is the turn of Mexican Spanish.
Ah, how great.
Because that is what is spoken here
Aha, yes.
Ay ah, I believe that Hispanics here are about ninety-five percent Mexican.
OK, of course, aha.
yes.
yes, because tonight's subject is technical gadgets.
yes, ah I use, I use computers
Ya.
ah ah, I have the ~D ~S ~L very rapidly now.
Mhm.
yes, and It fascinates me because I like the internet fast, I don't like to wait websites.
Yeah, right.
so for me it's very useful because I look for jobs, I do surveys, look for women
Mhm
a lo-, lots of things, and, and I don't like to wait for, the websites, you understand me?
Mhm. Ya, right
I like to do it fast, and before, when I was in line, in the phone.
yes.
it was really slow.
very slow, yeah.
So I had to wait two or three minutes only for one webpage to appear.
Yeah, of course.
and until now, well I have a webcam, and the webcam is really fast with ~D ~S ~L
yeah, of course.
The webcam is when they can see you, like TV, co-, video conferences
Mm. Mhm.
it's fast.
Mm, ya, of course.
And you?
Well, for me, as well, of course and I work, my jo-, I am an administrator and so uh, my job I use it and for me the computer, I mean the
the most essential, and above all uh, and in the new techniques, no? the new technology that has arrived and each day newer things come out, no?
yes.
Then, the truth is that I have adapted very well and I have loved it since I am using the computer, well um before when the typewriter was used, it was so slow to
type documents and reports, and all, now everything is done by the computer and the internet, no? I mean that is it something marvelous
for me, it's essential, I think that I wouldn't know what I could do if without the computer, no? So, the truth is that I am very happy with this new technology, and hopefully it continues
advancing more each day, no?
Mm, of course, I think that, they have, e-, they have done more a- advances on the computer than they have on, with medicine.
It's true.
The computer is the most advanced of the civilization now.
Uh huh, yes, and for everything, no? I mean that it's everything that one
yes.
wants they find it there and well when one sits at the well, I or use it for my work, but, well also and when I am at home and I need
some information, well I sit at the computer and there is no one to stop me, I don't know, that when someone is already like something, an essential part of one's life, no?
yes, exactly.
For everything, because if you need to know how the temperature is outside, well you go to the computer.
News, sports.
Before it was so, mhm.
Oh, going out with women, everything.
yes, yes, yes.
No, and even in this poll that we're conducting, i found it on the computer too.
Oh, yes, also, oh.
Yes, almost mm, then the computer has a lot of influence
Right, of course, ¿and how many calls have you made already?
in our lives. Twenty two, that's crap, uh, twenty two calls.
Oh, and uh, so you're finishing then.
I almost, i have to do about three, but o-, one call that the person spoke more in english, so i, i think I'm gonna have to replace it.
Oh, right, right.
Bu-, but ¿who knows?
Right, right.
Because i spoke in spanish, so they should count it.
Mm, right.
Because if you speak in English no, they don't count it.
But and, the payment is made after you finish the twenty five calls, ¿right?
yes, you do a, a call to replace.
yes, oh, right, right, yeah.
I went to talk to him, i know the owner of this
Oh, ¿yeah?
and, and I will ask him if I have to replace it
Oh, ah, You know the owner?
yes
Oh, that's good.
yes, is easy, is easy talking to him.
Oh, he's from, Is he from California?
No, he must be in Philadelphia
Oh, okay
but, but he gave me the tele-
Ah, but you know him personally?
No, no, no, no,
Oh, only through the computer
yes, I know him through the computer, but he
through the internet, okay, aha.
but he, he talks to the people that are participating.
Oh, okay, oh, yes? Oh, no, I never talk to him, I.
yes, then if you have any questions you can, he's Chinese
Oh, yes?
yes, well, I don't know if he is the owner, he is
Oh
the, the manager
yes
yes, that, by-, supervisor of, the project they are pursuing.
I see, I see, I see.
yes, and it is that they are studying how we speak Spanish
I see, sure, and
I don't know, if you would kni, if you knew
yes, yes, I knew, and besides yes, I think that they are also going to start another one after we finish this one.
No, I don't know it, but most probably yes, because I, I al-, I have one two already.
Hmm.
One in English and the other one in Spanish
Oh, this is your second one, oh is it?
yes, and this what we are doing now is technology
Oh. Oh.
because they are doing connections over the telephone
I see, I see Oh, and was the other one the same, twenty-five phone calls?
and this is techonology, yes, something like that, it was it was the same thing, but in English
I see, and they paid you, as well, the same?
And they paid the same
Oh, I see, I see.
Yes, I like doing this not only for the pay, but it gives me opportunity.
Ah, how wonderful
to speak Spanish
Of course
because it's the o-, the only time during the day that I speak Spanish.
Mm, yeah.
I, I speak very little Spanish now, most of my day it's English.
Oh, uh-huh
Yes.
Yeah
And what other technology do you use?  What we're doing now is technology.
We-, of course, sure it is.
You couldn't do this twenty, thirty years ago what we're doing now
Exactly, aha
because they're using multiple phone lines to connect many people who live in different part of the country.
Exactly.
I believe that phone technology has made advances also because I can make long distance calls and they don't cost me anything because you pay
uh, a monthly fee
Aha.
and you can make all the calls you want.
Oh, but here in
And that was not like th-, that was not like that like in five or ten, twenty years.
of course, but here in the United States.
Here in the United States, yes.
Oh, ya, of course, yes, yes, just know I have received one ah,  of Verizon that are offering me to make free calls here in the us.
yes.
and they give it to me and meanwhile the charge me.
if they charged you something monthly, but if you make a lot of calls, it is worth it.
yes, of course.
And you know what? One day they will make it international too to your favorite country.
Ay, how great.
You pay a monthly installment, and you can make the calls you want.
Yes, right.
Yes.
How great, right? Like so, it would be excellent to make country calls, there when one wants I think it will come, because with that thing about the cards too, right? every day
it was expensive before. did you remember before? to call the country of
And it is cheaper right?
Now it is really cheap, of course.
And why is it cheap? Because of technology.
Yes that, of course.
yes, the technology.
Now you can speak three, four, five hours for five dollars.
Exactly.
It used to be a minute back then, oh my god, it was like eight
A minute cost around twenty cents, yes.
And yes, I remember that when I had to call, I think I would only be able to speak for ten minutes and that would cost me around twenty five dollars.
Mm.
and so I had to be keeping track of the clock, no?
yes, yes, yes, I have been through that too
yes, aha
yes, yes, yes, I know what that's like, yes, that you are going against the clock.
Aha, sure, aha, yes
yes but, eh, with, with
yes, I've had, to be honest, I hope that technology keeps on advancing because I think that in ten  years, what else are they coming up with, right?
You know, this has to keep on advancing, right?
Because it's advancing and technology is now reaching more people
Mhm, Mhm.
so, services are cheaper, they are selling it to more people
Na, sure, yes
do you understand?
Mhm, sure
Eh, for example, the computer, five years ago, they were around two, two or three thousand dollars
Exactly, yes.
and now you can buy a computer for two or three hundred dollars
Ah, yes, that's true, aha
because there's, there is a lot of demand.
Now, sure, sure, aha.
Technology is advancing, it is advancing.
Ah, yes, it's true.
I would love to see
yes.
more advanced technology, with medicines.
Mm.
You have to look for cure to illnesses like cancer, eh, yes, you can go to the moon so, why can't they find a cure for cancer? Yes, it can be done, if they can do a
That's right.
super fast computer, one can think, why aren't they looking for a cure for cancer?
Mm. Mm.
I want to see some advances in cures for illnesses, I think that area is way slow.
Mm, I see.
I've not seen many improvements, in, in cure for illnesses in the past, ten, twenty, thirty, forty years.
Uh huh. Uh huh.
OK
It's true, because he already has cancer for some years
Yes, how many people, right? Kills
And they haven't found a cure, have they? They haven't found it, have they?
They haven't? And this shortens the lives of many people.
Yes, yes, yes.
Or, or heart disease too.
Uh huh. AIDS, now that it's spread through so many places
AIDS is more advanced than cancer in, in
Yes, that's right.
In the sense of being controlled because they already have drugs to fight it.
Yes, yes
But cancer goes more slowly, it seems to me.
Uh huh, yeah.
Have you heard of a discovery of a cure for cancer?
No, no, no, no, it's true.
Me, nothing. Nothing.
I see.
Very slow.
yes
The can improve this
Good.Clear
yes
I think not. I think that that something will arrive that that God shows, for that will arrive something that can cure this cancer catastrophe, the age is not important but it will be, but it will arrive, right?
yes yes
that occurs in anyone
I I had a friend that died young, at 31 years old and had cancer from one day to the next
yes, Already
and he died in three days
Oh my god. In three days? Oh
yes, but that day hisbrain was bleeding
oh my god
and he died immediately, she had leuke, leukemia of the blood
Oh wow
and from this, he had one day for another
Oh my God
mhm, and there was nothing they could od
Mm
not that not it
