But, my mother was coming and going. But, my mom didn't like it here for the cold time

Why not, and she says that, that, that what's it worth if you're stuck here behind four walls, and in Puerto Rico she could be going out and living at her house.

It's not the same.
Sure. Hey, that's- and so your Mom is in Puerto Rico now?

But, my Mother is Catholic, and my aunt is Catholic,

yes, alright.
and he tells her a lot about Father God, and asks her a questions about Father God, and my mother responds

but he doesn't like it because my Mom, am, after my grandmother died, my Mom she got rid of her eyebrows, my mom
Mm.
she put, am, holes in her ears so she could wear earrings
Mhm.
she shaved her legs, started wearing pants, wearing suits.
yes.
And, to my grand-a and to my fath- my uncle didn't like it
Mm.  Oh.
because he says that women should not use pants
yes
by, in his religion, in his religion,
He is, he is the bro- he is brother of his
of my mom.
mom. Right?
He says that, that, ahm, that women should not use pants because pants were made for men.
Mm.  yes.  yes
But, my uncle, i- is very, very, very, ahm, f- How is that?  fanatic with religion.

Sure.  yes, ma'am.
But, he is at church the seven days of the week.

Of course.
Us- Us- I tell him, you don't have to go to church to talk to God, because in your own bed, you can talk to God.
yes, ma'am.
The only thing that, that you cannot be asking father God only, how is it? to remember father God only when you have problems, but all the time.
Eh.  It is it is
because, there are some people who,
yes.
ay, my God, that give me this, ay, my God, that but when they are of that there is no problem,
Mmh.
then they don't remember that father God exists.
Of course.
Hello
Hello this is Milgred from Connecticut
Mercedes speaking from Philadelphia
How are you doing, good evening
Mm, good evening as well
Hm
Sometimes we talk about the religion anyway.
do you believe that joins or disjoins
Hm
Or do you believe that the world would be the same or better if we all believed in the same religion
Mm, I think that I, I think that it is what it is.
the world would be much better?
although we see the same religion but it's impossible  for all to have the same religion because there are always going to be cultural differences
See there see there
And, there is always going to be each person interpreting their unique religion in their own way. What's your opinion.
yea  I think it is the same and of course we are not all same races. So the each race has its
Your way of thinking say that although we are Hispanic sometimes we admire other that are in it, sometime we don't, and sometimes we or some other Catholic family and the family are
adventists or "um" from the evangelists
Hm mm
or they are from the from the taballas, they gave it, uh they sell them what are they called I forgot the name.
But, they are, or it could be, they are many religions, they are many, many.  We are many races and we are many religions.
sure
But, to me, other religions don't bother me.  I can interact with any religion later, always, and when they don't talk with me about, about getting into things that I don't want, understand
Exactly, that they don't go there
Sure, that they are not fanatics
that they impose, that you don't feel pressured, right.
yes
Concerning what they talk about, but, it could be, that, if I believe a thing, that is, how do you call it.  That religion if it separates for the same reason that there are differences
well, in that which one believes, the, the differences always exist.
Yes, religion is like politics.
exactly
It depends from, from what point of view you look at it.  Well, the whole world is not going to be in agreement, you understand.
For this reason they say not to discuss religion.  No, for this, for this I am not able to believe that we have a place to discuss religion in this program.
Sure.  But it is goo, it is good that, that they talk about everything, because in truth, if someone pays attention to me, I, I have aunts and cousins that belong to the evangelical religion.
sure.
and the majority of the rest are Catholics
sure.
And in it, on the other side of the family, also there are some who are away from religion.
sure.
but when we get together, no one is talking about religion, and no one is talking about, about, you know, about what you ought to be, and what you ought to change.  Nothing.
And the husband of my cousin is evangelic, always being inside the church. and she does not belong to the church. And they have the most happy marriage.
And her, her, she goes only in special occasions, like the mothers who do a ceremony for the mothers, when they have to,
en which they celebrate, because they don't celebrate Christmas, but they do something else there, other occasions that
Who are they?
The evangelics
Okay
Yes, the evangelics. So the husband of my cousin I tell you, he was and wasn't evangelic, they got married for that religion, and then after they got married, he got inside the church and she didn't.
Hm
And she drinks and dances, and she skips and he follows her to the work parties and all, and there he is present, and
I mean, he ain't saying to the people, ah you have to stop smoking, you have to stop smoking, you guys have no time.
Yes they joke in the parties, very good jokes, it doesn't get bad-tempered or nothing, you know, of this nothing, you don't say, the most happy.
Yes, I mean it's a person who depends on everyone, who who, how, he takes the person. but they get fanatics, never mind.
In my house what happened was
That is
what, eh my mom is evangelic
right
And my father did not, um, really go to church. He never defined himself
Right, well that is how he is, right, he is like my cousin
And, but  all of us went to catholic church.
O really?
Yes, then why do we not well... we are always Christians, so...
Ah ha
We had, or rather, what we learned in the [Sunday] school was not reinforced in the home.
Ah ha
And how if, I believe that of my brothers, only the majority are still Catholic. My younger sister... I think she's Evangelical. And I, no. I have decided that I don't have a religion
In other words you don't go to church or anything
No.
No.
Uh, huh, No.
I go to church, but I don't have what we call a "blessed nature" so that I am always there at church
Mmm hmmm. I don't. Since I, yes almost since I left, went to college, left college and then I decided that I would not return to ...
...to church. No. No, for me no. Truthfully, this is very interesting. And for me, organized religion? No. No.
You don't like it
No, not exactly... it's not that I don't like it, but I don't...don't feel the need... in other words, well I feel that God is with me in my heart
Ah ha
And that is how I live my life. But after that I was married and my wife is Jewish. My son is Jewish also. We are going to raise him Jewish.
Ah ha
Because I still believe that one needs to... to be brought up in a religion
Oh, yes, yes. I believe that is a very important foundation. Especially for children.
Yes. Yes, definitively. I...
But if we raise them with the least with ,with something,forget it that they will leave and,and they are what do I know they get they get wild.
Hm mm
they do not have feelings Or is they do not create a feeling relationship for nothing.
Hm mm,yes
I understand,like they don'care about anything.
yes yes That is why I agree that yes,yes he that the yes ne-the children they need well.that's why they say
and and,and you are you say you are cristian and that,and that a miracle that eh they accepted you in his family. seeing how Jews always
Yes? yes for real yes.
they are like you say,they are
we were lucky.
only between them that they try and get married,and that they have the same religion.
yes yes is for real,yes there is there is,say them of course there are those that are very strict,right
Yeah,ah
but no, my husbands family they have always been understanding,including the other son that got married the girl also is not eh
Jewish, And I believe that I imagine that maybe because I was the second no longer
but you married by jews,or you married by catholic?
No we had a relogion a Jewish ceremony.
Oh beautiful ah yes,yeah
yes and lets say that is what I say my son will be raised and I say it is important for him to be raised with religion
Hm mm
When he becomes an adult he can decide what he wants to do.
and what they say yeah.
Right,if I want to follow, or if i want Don't know leave something else to do whatever,but I do believe that religion whichever it may be, a child should be brought up with defined religion.
The my little girl, the big is is,were baptized and they are catholics,but the youngest even though she was baptaised catholic she visits also the church
the evangelical church.
Hm mm
She goes wih her husband cousin, and you know when she goes she puts her long skirt,yeah,yes like she respects her
their religion to them,and eh,she likes to go with them and I never said no when they ask if they could take her and me yeah yes.
you know.
That i do not understand because my mom lets say.my mon eh see-when she goes to church she needs to dress with a skirt.
Then ,I asked her what is bad about going in pants
Ah because eh eh,I believe the bible states the pants the man carries,something like that. Eh,
yes but but for me that is that for me that was one of the em.
is related to that.
reasons right,of of eh,not to leave not way, a little of what is organised religion, that are person that what the bible say,too strict they take
Hm those are the ones that became fanatics,that
Eh,yes.
They interpret word, for word what,what is is written.understand.
Hm mm
It's like the,the,those those Irakis with their doctrine that of,craziness,they kill people, in the name of,of
of that God they have, or of, or what they believe.
Hm mm
I mean that sometimes there are people like their mind, it, it gets distorted,
Hm mm
interpreting what in reality must be something that unifies.  Because the religion must unify, it doesn't matter which one it is.  It doesn't matter which one it is.  Understand.  I don't think that, because a person of one religion and another of another, well
they have to, to kill each other.  Because of that, because of that, because of that belief.
yes
So for me, since I am not fanatic about anything, I, I never become fanatic about anything.  I observe, I was raised in the Catholic religion,
and I helped in church, and I belong to the Daughters of Mary club, and I helped a lot in the church and all.  Those are
always have been my, my faith the, Catholicism, but not only, eh, the, it, like I took my children to the church, and I baptized them because it, I was raised that way.
But as adults, well if they want to go wherever they feel like, I will understand, it is not that they, that I have to say no, you cannot visit that other church,
or, you cannot believe in that, because Catholicism says that, that it is different.  You know.
Hm mm
And the majority of this, of this, some people who are in the gospel or in Jehova's Witnesses and they even try to stick things through the eyes, and want to come to your house, to, to, early in the morning to go and sell whatever there is
And I well, sometimes they knock, and I tell them, well look thanks I already have the little book, and if I don't tell them well, I am Catholic, and no
Ay, but it is that there are people, how great, I understand that they
Are imprudent.
their job is to conve- not their job, but they wish that people convert to their religion, right.  But they don't respect a no.
Aha, ah
True. O, o that maybe one, well there are peo-
There was a lady that came, look, every time i went through the door, the woman came with, with, look, that help us with this, buy our book, you know, that
that you're sinning, and i don't know, but is that I've been a sinner since i was born, my child. So, well, the lord there can reprehend me when i get up there.
Uh, yeah, they try to, i don't know, they try to tell you very negative things, instead of telling you, well, look, you can know more about the lord, and i don't know, than other
by other means, but that "you're a sinner", yeah, yes, i keep sinning and you're sinning right now talking like that.
hello
Good evening, how are you? Norma here in Atlanta Georgia, where are you from?
I'm Arturo I'm in, I'm in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia
ah, okay
nice to talk with you, where are you from Norma?
ah I'm Peruvian
Peruvian, ah my, my, my roommate is Pervuian
ah okay yea there's lots of Peruvians around here
from Lima, Mexicans too
ah are you Mexican
yes I'm Mexican
ah okay
from Mexico City
mhm
that's great, and what do you do in Georgia, do you work or study?
no I'm, I take care of my kids, I'm a stay at home mom
ah, okay, that's great and you, your husband is, is he from, also from
Peruvian, no, no my husband is
ah ok, Peruvian American
my husband is American, yes uh huh
Ah okay, very good
And so, What do you think about religion, about religions?
Well I think that this is from medieval times, and this
yeah
religion was lost during institutionalization, I mean to say that religion stopped being something spiritual
Hm
And became something more political and now recently in recent times it's stopped being so political but it has also brought a lot of those who
Hmm
Like the institutions therefore you can be very religious and spiritual
hmm
But not necessarily institutionalist so sometimes you don't necessarily have to be in favor of what the church says or in favor of what it says
One certain institution like Judaism, Catholicism, or Muslims, but sometimes you can also like I said mix a little of, or all philosophies so that
Better to use them to find a good way of life, better than nothing
hm
What do you think?
Well, I'm really very religious, I belong to a religion that is the Hare Krisha religion, I don't know if you've ever heard of it
Ah yes, yes, yes I have never heard, I don't really know what they're like, or what Hare Krisha is about.
Hmm, yes, it's based in a Hindu philosophy
yeah
So one of us believes that an individual is a part or portion of God and we also believe in reincarnation, we have rules and regulations, we're vegetarians, we don't eat meat, eggs, or fish
mm, we don't drink alcoholic beverages
And why not, because you don't eat meat, because you believe what?
because we that is we believe that that or that is each living entity deserves respect, and no, to avoid the violence against the enti- other living entities.
ah okay
now then therefore we do not eat meat, we do not get intoxicated with drugs or alcohol
uh huh
we don't drink coffee or tea
yes
and we don't do lasertag games.
Nor do we play lasertag.
no And are you religious? Do you belong to some religion?
and no I don't belong to any institution at the moment because I was born and I grew up Catholic but right now I'm bigger right now I'm twenty-one years old
like since I was eighteen years old already I didn't follow the institution because then I didn't, I didn't I didn't I wasn't much interested in what was, preached and
and I felt better than this before my spirituality, my contact with
mhm
with this with God then no, I didn't need to be across this institution then well no more this I dedicated myself to to reading about other religions a little, but more than anything no more to
to cultivate myself and to let's say practice a good way of life, but
mhm
because if I'm not any, I don't like the institutions.
ah but you do believe in God
Yes, definitely, but no
ah that is very good, or say lots of times one can not identify with one group of people or a group, no,
Exactly
but the important this is for one to have God right, in their heart, and that one tries to develop their relationship with God, that is very important
Yes yes precisely, recognize that it is true that
mhm, a higher being
a divinity above all things, no
clearly
but yes or well based off that I have changed a lot and in fact I also study chemical engineering and many times the people believe the sciences
say tear apart the peoples religion, corrupts
mhm yes
but I think the complete opposite because the people the begin to recognize the most scientific things, and things normally are also very religious because
because they began to realize that the more the get to know, the more they can explain
mhm
more questions arise and, and more discover that the world is unexplainable and that there are such things as miracles all the time and that they are everywhere
I feel that every time, the more the people know how the scientist and those people understand more, that there has to be something divine, a, a divinity behind it all
clearly a higher being that controls everything that happens
yes
clearly and realistically religion, or so religion or the beliefs that one holds on a higher power, especially the people that in the moment of a disaster and in the moment where there is suffering, then we always
right they always turn to and ask God to please help them, the whole world, there are many people including those that call themselves atheist, in the moment in which they are the most desperate always
they don't ask, they turn their face like that to ask God to help them
yes yes, yes, yes that
no that is really one is that is in their heart no, one feels that a supreme being really exists that many times no
yes exactly not only you have to turn to religion to ask for help, but also to thank
mm of course mmm
I believe that also many times  people well they become religious in certain moments because they need help but when they are already well, they forget that
yes yes that's why no, in philosophy  we have, there is always a- there is a, a verse that says, no that when you are suffering
yes
you always you always as help from God and that one should really, should should ask God to send suffering because that way you remember him more
because otherwise when you are well, you forget your relationship with God
yes
in e- in that it is true, no, because when you are doing well, you are very happy
yes you don't remember
no then you think that you are in control, no that one is the one who does that you are in control of all things that happen and that you like that you do acts, no
yes yes, yes
no but really it is what it is what God blesses you and helps in many circumstances.
yes, yes, yes, of course
and and you have a, do you have an idea about reincarnation or something like, karma law I have heard something, have you read?
well I have heard of karma no and like that like karma, I know I know I now it carries, no I mean if I had bad karma you are going to reincarnate into another being but to
mmm
For better, no for cleaning, no for have another chance of, of do your karma more good, more pure is not something like that
mmm yes ajá yes, one, the law of karma is a law of action and reaction that activities positive or negative doesn't have also a reaction positive or negative.
ah okay
no for that you a lot a time says, but why so many things that happen to the people, although are seen persons very good but really are
reactions of past lives that you are realized, actions very negatives and now is a reaction negative that is suffering
Yes
Really aren't persons that are very inocents, or persons that are very good that only the reaction is when you have free will
not to do anything, God doesn't force to believe in him, to serve or to realize his devotional service, for that
yes
you doesn't use the free will, and do negative activities that a lot a times is that reaction to the law of karma for that the law of karma, nobody frees of the law of karma, is infallible
yes,
mhm, that is what we think, what we believe, no
ah I see the Haré Krishna
in our relidion, yes
¿and what do you do? ¿you metts whit the Haré kishna every week or daily?
yes, now I'm married and live here in an aparment around the temple where we have
ajá
the temple here in Georgia, en Atlanta but before I live in the temple, I was hospitalized there, I live doing service to God
ah si
no, there are different types of service that you can do, you can preach, you can sing Lord's holy names, you can cook for the Lord, you can offer the food to God
and you do different activities, no
OK
not everything, i mean you realize the center of your life is God no, i offer him everything i do, every work, every cook, everything i do, from the moment you get up of your bed, you go to the shrine
and we offer are foo to our Lord so well now I'm married and with children so i have to worried about them
sure
now but if i always am going to the temple no and there always the devoted people join together most of the Sundays for grand celebrations that we have in the year
mmm
ah OK And do you have a prophet or someaone like Jesuschrist?
well we have Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada Ace Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada, he is devote to God he brought this knowledge here to the occident
OK
no he is like us really no, we honor him and
How is he calling?
well we respect very much to Jesus Christ too, its not that we didn't respect the other religions, other believes
yes sure
sure, but he brought the knowledge here to the occident about the krishna conscience like us, we call it the name of the city
oh OK
mmmm
How do you call that mister?
mmm
How do you call it?
it's called international society for the consciousness of Krishna
ah OK, OK, but, what's the name of the gentleman that brought it?
ah, his name is Ace Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada
Wow, he's Hindi of origin or, Where does he come from?
aha, yes he, he was born in India
ah, okay
well, he's no longer in the planet, he died when he abandoned his body
ah, okay, but then, it's possible that he's been reincarnated as someone else, or he won't reincarnate because he has karma
no, I mean, he's a devotee, he's considered a pure devotee of God, then he's back there in the spiritual world
ah, okay, so he won't reincarnate anymore
no, no, he hasn't reincarnated because life's goal in this world, in this material world is for us to develop our devotion for God
yeah
and for us to return to the spiritual world, and don't, don't come back again to this material world to the cycle of birth, disease and death that all living entities go through
yes, exactly
no, even animals and human beings
okay sure
no
and then, since he's above that level, and won't reincarnate again
hmm, yeah
okay
if he's above that level, he's a pure devotee
ah, very interesting
no, it's, it's really interesting, it would be good if you are not interested you can
and how long have you been in this religion?

then yes, yes I have a test on Friday then I was studying and I also have, I have many things this week, on Friday I also have a task to
a math class that I am in and I also have um eh I am in a marketing class of marketing and I also have other, some other task then
mm a little bit of each one
oh in one week you have a busy week but at least I have
yes you know
all these two days yes free yes
we are arriving to the end of this program, I think because I see, how many calls do we have already like?  I think that we are close no?
ahm I still don't I I  es that many nights I am busy and I can't then
ahh
only me maybe I only have twelve, thirteen, yes
ahh okay I will cancel it, I had a few days ago but just for about three days or something like that and then already like I am going around twenty I think or something like that
ahh yes that is why I want to hurry up because I know that now soon
you ___
there is already people that are going to stop doing that.
the issue is going to pass already but there are people that are now beginning
ahh
I talked with one person and told me this is my first call a guy from Peru
m
that by the way is in the same university in Pennsylvania
ahh
and studies and studies ahm of history, history
ahh, yes to almost everybody
what what
know someone in the the university or they study in the univiersity because
That's right
Its just that i don't how somebody will find out about this
yeah, wait a second their knocking on the door, and I've got to get it, one second please.
Ok, of course, why not
Hello, oh sorry, its been about four minutes
yes,yes,yes, it doesn't matter
its just that they don't open it when i want them to open it
um no but but it seems like the program has had various problems with computers before, or with the real devices they call.
yes ha
that record because it happened to me several different times, in the middle of the conversation, then the line cut off.
Its been three times for me, so then i
mhm, mhm shudong yeah
And he responded and told me that it was various people with that.
yes
With that problem, then i got another email from her saying that they had advised the participants that didn't know Spanish too well.
yes, of course
ha and to hang up when-
Yes shudong
ahh
yes shudong is what they say hang up but it does make me sad
I, not ca- to me, an alone lady of New York who do not speak very much Spanish but I talked with her twice, I laugh a lot because
ahh
Her name is Erdestina Did you talk with her?
mhm, mhm
Ernestina and as I am Josefina, we laugh
ah
and I tell her there is Ernestina, Josefina and then
yes
we laugh a little bit and she tell me and that about her family
But is she american? or
I don't know because I think the other day I spoke with someone who lives in her home and told me she was from an island, oh it's not
It's not Granada but it was an an island of
mmm
there, Caribbean, which have a special language and no, it's something like that
ah and it's not necessarily Spanish
yes, but maybe she understands, well yes one
yes yes yes
rightly explained she understands, look and about the e-mail, Did you buy? with Didn't you request?
No necer, never, Me, What I have is, in my account of, because I have two accounts, one by hotmail and one in
in the university, and they almost never send me in the university one anymore
no,
like unsolicited mail but in Hotmail all are terrible, every day I receive
ah
twenty, twenty five messages and all of them junk but
aha that you won this, what you get I get them through MSN, I have MSN
mhm
then that Josefina was awarded with this that she go- press here and you have a free scholarship and you got I don't know
ah
and a trip, uh and cruises and
eh yes
and I delete them because those are to find out
yes
if you answer not to
yes, the sa-, yes the sad part is that with but for because what people that send all these mails that they have, they put, ah make programs
that go through the Internet of the site from a website to another website and then when they find
mhm
an email address
ah
they put it on a list and then if
I say how do they find out so much about people, no?
yes yes then and also go to the news group and also go to
so strange people
yes all all all and then it is very easy that for example the boards, for example the board of hotmail I imagine there also
they look for names and they look and then they created an enourmous list
wow
and with that list they create the message right and then they send to everybody in the list but  then, the quantity that work that requieres is so little it is very litte, right?
mhm, mhm
and yes two or three people answer from thousands of people that they already earned enough money for for whatever
to cost the expenses no?
yes yes that is sad that, it is that
but it is
with two or three stupids they bother all of us, right?
but that is horri horrible because this one I have somewhat controlled with the filter they download, I don´t know, they gave me a spam filter
mhm
I ordered, I did not buy it but they put from MSN no
mm
they filter a little but not always the junk where it says junk it is, theere are ten or twelve a day, no?
yes alwyas happens like that, I read an article that I think it is very interesting that Microsoft is now creating a software that does
am every time one sends a message the computer has to do a I don´t know has to break a code or do similar task that is not
very very big
aha
so, it does take some work, right? If you are just sending an email, writing an email and then sent it, you can't even tell, right?
so
so, when, so when the computer does that stuff, so it breaks a code, it does exactly that and Microsoft then gives you a certificate for the email, that the email
that the person wasted a little time doing that, right? So, if you are just sending two emails, it doesn't matter, the email gets through and you know it's not spam but if you are sending millions of emails
mhm
you have to, your computer can't process them, they can't work that much, right?
aha
to send so many emails, it gets delayed and possibly, it is expected to get delayed, it's too much
too slowly and they can't send all those emails that they send nowadays.
ah
and when you get an email without that certificate, you know it's spam and you can delete it
or it has to have an annex or attachment or something that asks
yes, yes, I don't know for sure
you if you want to open that email or you said
I don't know for sure but I, I thinks that the idea
aha, mine has it, I mean I've been through that when I send mails via Yahoo because I have an account, a division
mhm
in Yahoo that does that when I'm going to send an email, it asks me to identified something, like a code, you have to do it or
mm
says this is to protect
yes
messages something like that
yes, yes
so I places the pieces, the the letters however I see them
aha
but sometimes di-, is a pe,r, jay
hmm
you and a number and something like that
and the numbers yes
you have seen that it is like a crossword, like a puzzle, no?
yes I have seen them, yes mmh, mmh
I don't know if that is what
yes, I don't know, I don't know
to protect
but it seems to me that the filters are not are not very like effective actually because yes one things that that that no that every time that you put because one can say ah well if you have a
a., a, how do you say it suspect phrases can be sent to spalm actually but many times then
ah yes
the ones who create spam you know which ones are the, the the suspect phrases then or phrases that that in general activate the truth filter
ohhh
then they create the message in a way that it doesn't
it doesn't filter
that it doesn't catch the filter, yes yes then
ah and how is it in the, in the forums, you have thought about those forums those from from Univision or Telemundo
ahh yes every once in a while
and when you write a word like stupid or idiot this does not does not capture it, no? I mean it says we don't allow this type of vocabulary in this
ay how interesting
Hello How are you?
Aodri Hi, And how are you?
Very good, I'm Miguel Angel, and I'm in Philadelphia and you?
My name is Aodri and I'm in New York
you're in New York, mm are you? from Argentina, don't tell me
No, I'm Peruvian
Oh, I'm sorry! since you had the "cho" you know since you said New "chor" well I thought, I said this one is from Argentina
You're not the first person, don't worry
Oh, good, good
But tell me
What is? What's your name
Odri
Atri?
Aodri
Ah, oh, oh Odri, like Odri
Yes, yes exactly, exactly
That's good, that's good, very good
Well what do you think about the mail? Unsolicited
what do I think of unsolicited mail, well that is a nuisance
yes
they thre it immediately to the garbage
No,yes, I ohm
when it arrives
To me that, when I open My e-mail and I see a lot When I see that puts me, oh And I say: Oh this!, because sometimes it says to me like
It gets on my nerves
five, nine messages and I have who has written to me And I see there are five new four
yes yes,
They are direct for the trash
mhm Good and of, and that the email is already a scandal, about spam
No, but the good thing is for example, the service I use for mail
What do you use, yahoo?
What is it called No I use Gmail Then
oh, Gmail yes, yes
yes, they can and you can designate
mhm
That Like them Since I do not know how they do it, but they have a way of verifying that like it is span [spam] And, puts it in another folder
mhm
Then ah, I these Work, I am not going to say that ninety percent works very well
yes yes I have, if it is true, I have yahoo and also, and also what is the spam puts It in another distinctive folder and
yes
And if you don't want to read, you don't, ¿right?, you don't read if you don't want to
Yes, uh, i think so
Uh, yes, ¿right?, no, that's true
I believe that most mail tech support have that now because its, its like an invasion because they try every way to pu
words like it was a conversation, and it's not just in English because I'm telling you
Oh, no, on
I also get plenty in spanish, uh
yes, yes, yes
My personal mail and my work mail and i get plenty, plenty, plenty
Uh, yeah, no, about the Spanish i, look, I've been living in Spain, ¿right?, until last year, i haven't been here more than a year, ¿you know?, in the United States
And, well, in Spain it's the same, i mean, there's a lot of spam there, i don't know, ¿right?, the language doesn't matter there, so, that's international now
Bad things get everywhere right away, uh
So you've never bought anything from a spam
Uh, i have bought, i have bought stuff over the internet, i mean, I've bought books in amazon and i've brought tickets for concerts and all that, but it has always been on my own initiative, you know
Uh, yeah, well i want to buy a book, or i want to buy some CD or i want to buy a ticket for a concert or for the movies, whatever
but just like that, because i wanted to, you know, never because they sent me a spam email and i opened it and bought, because i just don't read it, you know, i delete it
So no, and when i get something on the mail that i didn't ask for well, the same, i just throw it right away, you know, i don't even look at it.
And sometimes, man, sometimes it's true, i read it, ¿right?, but, no, generally I'm never interested in it, and, ¿have you  bought anything?
No, not me, not me, but i remember that, it might be almost a year ago, that i read an article on the paper about a man that
uh um
And yes, he loves to buy things, crap
Hmm
He lives for this, but I, it seems to me I've never known anyone who
Yeah, yeah
Who bought spam because for everyone, he got them angry when they see the blessed spam that this, that the other and I
At least the majority of these things are, they sell you things that, then, then they don't send you then, they take your money
They send you something of very low quality, or that they sell you these things, they aren't, they're totally because they sell them, we sell them, and then the best sometimes
I know people who bought it and then afterward said it was shit, this is a thing that breaks after two days or
Or spoils or you know, that after aren't things of quality just because you say they are
Yes
If you say they are fine, that it's the same, this whatever, no, but everything is spam, it's all a scam.
Yeah, it's really in bad taste
It's like, it's like the sale of things in all these catalogs that have
really absurd things, then, something to scratch your back and this is, have you seen these catalogs filled with shitty things, with shit?
I've seen them, they are really stupid things
Yes yes, no, yes, you know something
Yes, for example, a
Perhaps if you have a reason to have them but it's a thing that, why spend the money
And have you seen the latest thing, it's like little boots that you can plug in to warm your feet, have you seen them?
Yes, yes
yes, And things like that, no, that they sell you like that, the lady comes out like that. The man with his feet inside that little boot, that
it warms up and warms your feet I sometimes think who buys that,
No but you know what I always say, I say someone has to be buying that for them to send them how they send them
Of course
And, they enacted some laws like, in the state of Virginia is illegal
mm
Send a spam, an unsolicited email
yes
But even then I still get a lot, I get a bunch
yes,
Is also like for example the ones that call on the phone, Oh oh, those they, they really drive me crazy, when I see
Oh, no, no the ones that call you on the phone, yes, I tell those straight up no
yes,
I am sorry, I am sorry, I am not interested, and that's it and I hang up
No, no, no, no, I'm not as sweet with them. No, no, no I tell them what are you doing with my name, delete my name immediately
So, there is something, I don't know if it's federal but I know is from the state, our governor did it And that is of a cover
And that you can, you can put your name and if someone calls you they have to pay a fine because it says they weren't supposed to call you
yes, I, I have my boss, my ex-boss, what he would do when they would call him, from one of those cards, for a raffle, I don't know what
Eh, from the mortgage He would say wait a minute and he would leave them there waiting, because he said Look when I need to speak with customer service of anything, credit card, bank, I don't know what
they always put me on hold for a really long time, so I love to tell them
yes
hold and leave them there and that, his things, he loved to do that
I know, man, that you don't know what's going on, I feel a little pity. The people whom work in those, is not that, don't laugh, but it's true
I feel, I feel pity about the people whom, whom have to work and earn a living calling, then, you know, they call you mister and I'm not interested and of course I say I'm not interested and I hang up
But I try to be a little polite because you know the people is working and earning a salary by calling, as operators calling they're not very pleased
with people treating them bad and harrasing them, and getting hanged up like that without an answer because I wor-, I worked, then everybody
I don't know, when I was younger and I was a student and so, then Then I had, well I'm still a student but when I was younger
But man, well, in summer, you know, you have, well, a wor- I worked as operator And no, It's wasn't selling, no, I didn't sell, I
Ah
I got calls incoming, in other words no, I didn't made calls
yes
And I worked for a supplier in Spain. And I worked for an insurance company
yes,
And what was a, how is it called here, like here, Roadside Assistance
Ah, okay okay
And I called people whom has gotten. Whose car had broken down and we did send them a wrecker to take them the car to a garage and so
And I, of course, I mean I used to work eight hours a day and there is a moment in which you burn out. I mean you get tired that everybody calls with problems
And well, and, insulting you and telling you that when is that assistance is coming and so, and you know treating you bad, and it's not your fault at all, because I was a complete nobody
I was a worker in the company and I had no idea, you know, if the company is good or bad, or what, I only got paid to, to
answer the phone and give a service the best I knew, then to me, you know, that why I feel a little pity about the people who calls
Those people calling have no intentions of harassing, they don't want to bother people, they have to eat too, just like you and me, you know
and they want to have a job, so
yes
I don't know I do feel somewhat sorry, or understand this, that yes,they should not feel, that because I feel sorry for them I am going to buy the product they are selling, that would be too much
you know, but at least treat them good, tell them look, I am not interested, and that's it. But as it is said, people in the United States have lots of attitude
yes
That's one thing I notice, I perceive a cultural difference, you know, and as for Spain, it is what you'll call "intrusive"
yes
yes, that to me, I don't know, or you know, Sometimes you have to be intrusive because people bug you to death sometimes, but
when there is no need to be "intrusive", don't be, you know
You are right is always that way, but no, I am not lying by saying no, I am always there, I don't want to say no and I don't want oh.
I understand
Because it is always the same thing, especially when they call me on my cell phone, I say:ah
Sure, Sure
In the middle of the day or sometimes at work, I don't know, and I have a lot of stuff to do
yes, yes
I'm not here for you to be bothering me
Hey, Odri, tell me, what's a Peruvian woman with an Argentinian accent doing in New York?
Well, you know, it's a long story, well, first, well, I was born here, my parents are Peruvian but then my parents left
yeah
they left their countries when they were really young
yeah
neither of my parents has a Peruvian accent, even my granny doesn't have one, my grandfather didn't have one either
hmm
Uhmm, my grandfather lived in Argentina for a decade and
ah, right
he was, very attached to the Argentinian culture and all that
Ah, that's why
Yes, then my mom has a little bit of an accent
hmm
And, well, I have it, I have a stronger accent, but I even work for an Argentinian studio
ah, right
Then their accent rubs off on m, yes, yes, but no, but between you and me, it's a legal studio but
Hello?
Hello? Good day.
Good day. Ah, my name is Jenny and I'm calling from New York.
My name is Anni, and I'm calling from Miami.
Ah okay. Hello.
Hello.
Um can you wait a moment. The other telephone line is ringing, I'll be right back.
Okay.
Okay.
Hm mm I'm, I'm coming out
Hello?
yes, no, no it doesn't matter.
Sorry Ah, What was the, the theme of this call?
Music
Ah okay. Well, start. yes, yes you should start
Ah. Music. eh. We pass the entire day listening to music. I have a daughter of twenty-three months.
Oh okay.
And no. I did not say that she watches television, but I always have
Uh, hmm
Music on. That was her throwing a pl- a plate at the floor. Because we are trying to
Oh, okay
Pardon.
No, that is good. Don't worry.
Eh. But, you know, we spent the whole day listening to music
Hm mm
classical, or, or, you know, of of, to play, or whateverit is. And we listened to it in English and in Spanish.
Ah, okay
So here when your, father is in the house,we talk English only,
Hm mm
but when, he goes to work, we speak only in Spanish,
Oh yes, Okay. I understand.
So But, eh, and you?
Ah, good, me, uh, Normal- I, I, Oh, listen to all kinds ofmusic
Aha.
I don't have a favorite, I can go for all. Even music in another language.
Aha.
Um. And yes, I pass the whole day, listening to differentmusic, because as they say, music calms
Hm mm, hm mm
Until the most ferocious animal eh, I think it is so. So in these moments, I work at, at home.
Hm mm, hm mm
And I also work in the court. So when I'm not discussing something in the court, I'm at home. And, in that moments when you feel more agitated,
Hm mm
Oh, the best time to turn on the radio, and listen something to relax you and put you back, in the
yes.
in the way you should be thinking. Um, not yet, I don't have children But um, I was some years working in a pre care
Okay.
And that was the best, when you wanted that
Hm mm
A class of, of eighteen kids of four years get calm down.
yes.
play a, a or some music eh, classical
Hm mm, hm mm, We
And it is like changes the, all the mood in the room. Because, yes this affects the sense of, of of the animal human, you can say.
Well we had a
So Hm mm.
not a awkward time, but my daughter all like two months ago she started to sleep at night, entirely
Oh, okay.
But when she was seven, eight years old we took her from our bed,
Hm mm
to her cradle. And I could not, you know, I had a lot of difficulty to putting her to sleep, and at the end I found that if I, eh, put her music, with a sound machine,
Um, um.
You know, that she sleeps well. And now, uh, we bought her an iPod
OK
Because, uh, what i do is, i have, you know, a month and like a hundred something CD's
Um
So, i, i can choose what i want her to hear. Normally, when we put her to sleep.
Uh, um.
We pick the, you know, the, the lullaby songs, i think they're called
Yeah
So, uh, i, i turn the music on, i turn on her machine of, of, the sound machine
Uh um.
Well, we read her a few books. And that's it, she knows that when she hears that, you know, she, she goes to sleep. She sleeps better. I, uh, i put her to sleep in her crib now. And in like fifteen minutes, she's already
Wow, so she has her routine
sleeping, yeah, and that's why, that's the reason why, one of the reasons why we bought the, the iPod.
Uh um.
Because also, when we're in the car, she wants her songs and what ever, and for one to carry, you know, carry five hundred and something CD's, have them in your car
Oh, yes, it's better to bring the iPod than
And, but she's also a, well, she's not, sometimes she, uh, does baby modelling.
Uh um.
So we bought her iPod with the money she
Oh.
She herself does, you know
Aha.
that she herself, eh, she worked.
So it- it is, kind of, like her vagrancy, they did it
yes, yes.
Ah well, that is a good idea.
We did it- well part of her, and part mine, because I have my music there too.  So, you know,
Well, or- like no.  It is not going to be just her music anymore.
yes.  So
Oh, oh, that's how things are
Well, probably ninety-five percent is hers.
Oh, wow
And that, you know, because like that if we are in a place, whatever it is, because the, the little cart is hers also.
Hm mm
it has, like, eh headphone.
yes.
but with that, and, and when we bought it, I thought who is going to put a, you know, a Walkman or something and now I am doing it
No, that is the best, that is the best because I tell you the point of view of a person who was an educator
yes, me too,
The music that is- that, the kids that the parents, they, they let them, they cultivate a love of music in them it's like um, teaching them to read.
Because it helps them with their concentration, with, uh, their movements, if-, if, if you've ever watched kids you, when they hear piano music,
they move their little fingers as if they were playing a piano. All of that helps,
Hm mm
for the, uh, development. I forgot, I forgot how to say development in Spanish
yes. Yes, I understood you don't worry. Yea.
Well the development, there we go. The development of the kid for e-, for yesterday, so it's quite a marvel. Because I'd always though that. I tell my husband all the time. When we have kids,
there are some things, that you're going to think that are a bit crazy. I was telling him, that I want
yes.
you know I want to give birth in a bath with water, with music, and he's just like uh huh. You're half crazy
No, but look, we're going to have the, uh, our next baby,
Hm mm
God willing, within a week
Oh wow
And, you know, that's what we're doing. We're going to go to the, to a maternity center that's here, and that's what we're going to do.
Hm mm yea
Because you know, for me, the first one was a Cesarian, and
Ooh.
no, and it wasn't, because I wanted it. It was supposedly for an emergency.
Oh, okay, oops, sorry. It's the dog. Shh, shh, quiet.
But I think that  OK
I'm sorry
That's OK, Then
aha
You know, ther, therefore we are going to do that. And with her, she doesn't watch any television
That's the best, yea
you know, eh. A lot of times when we take her to church, and they show her, you know, the dolls of Elmo
Ummm,
or whatever, she just looks like what's that, and the people looks at me, like she doesn't know who is Elmo and I, because we don't watch television
No, that, that's the best, the best method of, to make sure the, the success of your kid. Eh maintain all that. That's the problem with my husband
And I tell him, because his mother was a little weird because she taguht him, he left him in front, in front of the television always
aha
And I don't think I have a television untils I was thirdteen. Mi mother and dad did not buy the television, we did not have any of that. He is the only one that thinks is weird
that I was always very advance in school. In the scholar system I was advanced, ah, I finish University early, and he waited for me. All I have done I've done it fast
and with easy, and I'm not sure about him, I always tell him because I did not have all the distrac- distractions. I did not have a television that took awaya one or two hours
of studies. You know that everything was always, was focused, my mother and father were poor, but if, one of us wanted to play music my mom and dad did whatever they could so I could go to take music lessons
You know, if we were interested on animals, we went to the museum
yes
on the weekends, or, you know, there was alaways something about education. So, one only grows for a short time, so when you are already, eh , a teenager
grows, and, and sees the difference, adn the one's friendships know about this, they know about this
yes
and you feel strange, but after, when you are more more mature now, I look, and say thanks. I always say thanks to my mom, my dad, thanks a lot. Because now
I can buy all those things I want, if I want an Ipod, I buy it. I have one.
yes.
if I want, uh, a playstation, we have one there, it just sits there gathering dust
yes
because we don't play it. It doesn't interest me, and my husband says you're not going to sit and play, I don't want to play with that either.
yes
So it's there. But I also see the benefit that I didn't waste my youth
Well, and also, you know, I, since we are going to have a baby, I was thinking that we are going to have her
Hm mm
not watch tv, but, I was searching to see what educational program I could let her watch, but
Well, nowadays there are a lot of programs
yes, but I, I still couldn't.
Depends No, there's, there's a lot, they have, in channel thirteen they have like two, that are safe, two, that have the approval of, of the school system here,
yes, but.
in New York.
what happens to me, is that, I know that the tv, I'm not going to have any problem eh, to get her interested.
Hm mm
And that I prefer, if I can, to wait til she's at least three or four years old,
Hm mm
that she continues with the love of books, and music, and all that, I rather prefer, you know, that we continue with that.  I don't know.
No
yes when the ba- the baby arrives, that, that I am going to feel that that in order for me to, have a little time, you know,
what I'm going to do the most, if I do it, is going to be half an hour a day, and it is going to be a program that I know that
Hm mm Yeah
you know, it is educational.
Well, I, I have faith-, I don't know you, but I have faith that you are going to do a wonderful job, because of the way I hear you speak
it is all that I, in my mind, saw and said, OK, this is what I want to do.  This is what I want to see and when I talk with my husband he, ah
I don't know anymore, I don't know But
But al-
but it is, it is- I'm hearing you and I can tell that he is good, you know everything you say is perfect.  No, there is nothing
what I would do different, like who says.
Well, the, the biggest difficulty we have is that, no- we don't watch much television
Hm mm
But, and, if you go into our- our home of ours, you would think that we watch much television with, because our house, eh brings a,
came with one of that, fifty-two-inch televisions.
Oh my goodness, OK
Then, also, last Christmas, we bought a TiVo.
OK
Then, we rec - record, you know, those old movies or the shows we want to see but
Hm Hmm Hmm
but it's nothing, we never watch ABC, NBC, none of that
Oh, yes, that's the better part
It's always the Discovery Channel, or, you know, things like that, like the History Channel
Yeah, yes
But because of that, because I don't want her to watch TV, my husband, he's watching less TV
Oh, yes
because when he's home, and she's awake, we don't, you know, we don't turn it on
Oh, okay, okay
So, that, that was one of the difficulties we had, because, he, he, you know, he understands that I don't want her watching televi
sion, but he doesn't understand that if he's watching, then she's watching
It's like, like allowing her to
Yeah
yeah. That's, that's the problem I have with mine. I mean, because I also don't watch TV. I'm in the room all the time
Hi
hi
Hi, my name is Zulma, from texas.
oh, I'm Manuel from chicago.
Hi Manuel
How are you?
Good and you?
Good,good
Are you a dad already?
Sorry?
Are you a dad once again?
Yea, I'm a dad again.
ha, there was not a problem.
no, everything was fine.
ah, that's good, thats good.
I just had my baby in my arms about five minutes ago.
ha
They took her to eat.
mhm, and are you already home, or are you still in the hospital?
Yeah, we're home, no, we left the hospital the following day that the baby was born.
Ah, that's good.
everything went well, and no, we were only, after he was born, the birth, twenty four hours, that was all.
Mhm. Now, to wake up every, every two hours
yes.
Aha.
Every two hours and you have to feed him.
Mhm.
Well, you're giving him, ah, breast.
Mhm.
So, you don't have to worry about giving him, the prepare the milk, or anything.
Mhm. Ah, well. So, you don't even need to wake up.
It's OK. No. That- Nothing, not at all, once or twice I wake up, no more, but only to be with them, there.
Mhm.
That's it.
I spoke to, am, Jenny,
yes.
and I spoke to you brother. But, I forgot his name.
Ah, really?
Because, yes, he started doing it. To do the study as well. Because, ah, Jenny stopped taking part.
How come she hasn't told me about it?
yes, the, that is, that he told me when I spoke. Because, you see that I spoke two, twice I had to talk with a lady from New York,
.
and she spoke but, very little Spanish, very, the Spanish, she spoke it very badly.
Yeah.
Then, I sent an email to the person from the study, and I asked what happened if I, ah, I happened to speak with someone who didn't speak Spanish very well.
yes.
And, he told me to hang up quickly, to cut off the call, because it wasn't going to count this call for me.
Okay.
Then, he sent an email to everybody, saying that if you speak with someone who doesn't speak English -- eh -- Spanish well,
eh, don't talk with that person.
yes, I also got an email from them.
yes.
.
Then, it seems that, or your brother told me that Jenny read that message, and that then she decided not to participate any more.
yes, yes I commented something about that, but, ah, I- I, she didn't tell me that she was going to stop participating. Nothing more she told me that she had,
that she thought that it was for her.
Ah, uh huh.
Ah.
No, no, I told your brother, that said that, that I was who sent that e-mail, and that, and that, I hadn't sent it because of her, I had spoken with that other lady that didn't speak any Spanish, very few words that she knew how to say in Spa-
Em.
Oh
Beacuse, I think she speaks Spanish really well
Yes, she does
Mmm
She is, is funny, you get inn her car and she has a Minivan, a Caravan
yes
And sometimes I felt strange. I got in, when I was in Nebraska with them
Mmm
And I drove it some days, and I grabbed the thing where she keeps the CD s and
Mmm
if she had some Spanish music
Mm
and well, she had like 73 CD s
Mm
alll of them in Spanish, ten I asked her: Hey Jenny, Why do you have all that Spanish music?, I mean Why all in Spanish?, and she told me that she like it everything in Spanish, she don't listed to English music
Oh
Oh, and I said: That's good!
Mmm
yes, she knows everything and well, I don't know how long she has been practicing Spanish, or talking Spanish, but she speaks really well
Oh, And how log has she been married with your brother?, Because it sounded like your brother's sons are big now
Oh, what happens is, she had the child from before
Oh, she had him,
But, they are like, I'm not sure, around four years old.
yeah.
three or four years.
yeah, oh
Yeah and she had, has children from her previous marriage
yes.
Oh, they only have a daughter.
Mmmmhmmm
from my brother.
Because, I don't remember what we had to talk about, but your brother was telling me, hmm, no, I was asking him if he had any trouble living there in Nebraska,
since there are not many hispanics. And, he told me that in the neighborhood where he lives, there aren't any, there are no hispanics, he is the only hispanic.
yeah
And, I told him if the had any troubles with the people there looking bad at him, or speaking bad to him, and he told me no, that he only had trouble once with,
the father of one of the other kids that did wrestling with his kids.
Oh yeah, one, one of them wrestles.
mhm
but, you know, you'll find good and bad people anywhere
Sure, yeah, that always happens.
yes.
But well, he said no, that he didn't much problems, the fact, the invited all the world to the Christmas holidays, and all
yes, I did realize that. They are not that, I think in a town where there isn't much Hispanics, there is nothing.
Mhm
And you know, where there is a lot of Hispanics, there is many, well, the bad friendships starts, and all that, the bad people.
Of course, eh
so, the Americans start to think negatively, not him anymore.
Mhm
That is, an Hispanic. They start to think all of them same, they think
Of Course
And since there ain't none, they don't have
prejudices, yes, mhm.
yes. They don't think, he is a Mexican, he is not doing this or that.
Mhm, mhm.
No, I think, they haven't, haven't experimented with Mexicans much.
yes.
And for that reason, there isn't, there shouldn't be Mexicans, well, there is no one to do evil deeds.
Mhm
You see that Mexicans throw a party, one or two am in the morning, and with the music as low as possible.
Mhm.
And there is nothing of that. Until now. Now already, soon more Hispanics will start arriving.
yes, true. It happens.
yeah
and you, what music do you listen to?
Texan
Texan, yes. Mhm
I like very much, I lived much, uhm, some time is Texas.  I like like what is called Tex-Mex, very much.
Mhm
All is music
mhm
and even, here almost, sometimes, I can't find those types of disks, I look and, but, here since no one hears it, it is not heard much here
ah,
So then. But, yes, sometimes, when, my siblings come, or that I go there, I bring music from there are.
And the traditional Mexican music, do you like it?
I like Northern, most of the time, the northern
Mhm. Mhm.

Mhm
Not heavy
Oh, I see
Yes. I have, in my car, I always bring my music. And if someone gets in, I like to listen to it, but not loud
mhm
Just for, it's like music relaxes me, sometimes.
Of course, yes, it's cool to listen to music in the car. It enterntains you, specially if you are alone in the car, it's nice to listen to music
yes
I'm not one of those who listen to music all the time, I have friends who listen to music all the time. And now that people have those MP3s
yes
where you may have eighty, one hundred, two hundred songs. They have that in the ears all the time, listening to music
No, that I don't like, I don't like it so much like this
yes, I don't like it. Me just sometimes, yes, to relax, or in the car, or if go for some exercise, then I like to listen to music too
yes, there people who don't, cannot sleep.  Ah, my brother, the one who lives in Nebraska
Aha.
he, there was a time that he fell asleep, and if he didn't have music, he didn't sleep.
Ah.
And I told him, turn off the radio, you cannot sleep with music, not without, without music, you cannot sleep pleasantly.  You say, away, and happily awake, I slee, and I sleep happily.
Each one
yes, I like to wake up with music.  Then, my alarm, it is also a, it is a player.  Then, when, the alarm in the morning, instead of being a sound one of those that
kills you of a heart attack,
yes
it is, it is the music that I have in the player.  Then, it is good like that, because it wakes you up little by little.
yes.
Aha.
And you go to, you go out there in, I don't know, dances, or discotheques? In Texas?
When I got here to Houston, I used to go out a lot to dance salsa.
yes.
yes, and I found a group of people there where I went to school, who danced salsa and went out a lot.  But, not anymore.  Now I don't have any time to go anywhere.
Aha.
But, then, I don't, like I got tired of going out because I had already gone to all the same places, and you see the same people, and
always, the places were but too full of people.  Then, you went to dane, and you almost couldn't dance, and people stepped on you or they gave you when they were turning.  Then, no, well, I, I got tired of that.
yes.
also we have to pay so much to go into these places
that yes
it cost ten or fifteen dollars to go into these places then, no, not anymore. like i perfer to go to a more calm place now
ah
yes, just sit there and talk, and
there's a dance hall where Mexican groups come
mhm
like country and all that
yes
you arnt going to believe it, they charge fifteen dollars to go enter
wow. but they bring well known groups, o? yea
yeah yes, yes, group- yes. and, even like that, people can not enter
wow. but its that, you live in a large city

then,
i went one time and i liked it because its pretty
mhm
what happens is that i can not even walk
yes, and no. this is the problem, yes
the way they are, they have groups, ah, good Mexican groups, all the people want to listen to them
Of course.
yes the hall has capacity for four thousand people, the same ones that go in. And no. Since the only time I went there, I never liked going there again.
yes.
And so, I don't go out anymore, for the reason, that is too much trouble. You go out. Hello?
Hello?
Oh, I thought we had gotten disconnected.
No, no, no. I'm here.

Oh, long time.
Yes, very. And you?
I've been living here for ten years, this year.
Wow
Still, that's not as much, but it seems like it, no?
Isn't it cold there?
It's beginning to get cold, but no, not as much as in Chicago.
Oh yes, here in Chicago it's very cold.
Yes, that
Especially the snow.
Oh yes, I've heard that it's terrible, terrible.
ha
My brother lives in Chicago as well.
oh yeah, what part?
yea, ahm I'm not sure, because i don't live there, but around the university of chicago.
ha ha ha
and i think they live real close, it seems like the apartments around the university are
oh okay okay okay
so I'm not sure then
look, you know today's theme? right?
yeah, music.
ha ha
And well, well its like Puerto rico, what kind of music do you like?
i like bachata a lot.
bachata, whats bachata?
its a kind of music, its not slow music,
ha
nobody really sings that kind of music, and alejandra, Alex bueno, me as well, have found CDs at the library.
oh yeah
To hear them, i also like regueton, i don't know if you listen to regueton, its popular now.
yes,yes I've heard it before.
from "Daddy Yanky" " Don Omar" "Tego Calderon" "Ivi Queen"
and from, and from. So, living in chaicago hasen't made it hard for you to keep listening t othe music you listened to in Puerto Rico. Right?
No, it's not the, almost
Because many
it's almost the same
Well not. There is a great variety in Chicago
Aha, aha, aha
So you haven't missed that a lot, have you?
No, no, because before
Great!
Ther, in Puerto Rico, I listened to 'Boleros' and 'Salsa' but I didn't really like 'boleros' and 'salsa' because you can't dance them
Of course
They are more romantic
Sure
, butt we use 'merengue' a lot
aha
like 'Olga Tañon', 'Elvis Crepo'
Oh, yes, yes
And here in Chicago, there ia a lot of Purtorican parade
Oh, nice
And they were invited. This year came "Ivy Queen" which is the baby of the Reggaetton
en 2004 we had Elvis
Oh
Crespo
Oh really?
Yeah, then
here in Idaho, nobody gets here
No
No
Here we also have a boricua party, which is in September and we had Tego Calderon, there are always a lot of concerts, in parks, and open air
That's cool
And they are free, There is also something they do a lot which is called "Viva Chicago"
Oh, I see
And they bring a lot of Colombian music, from Mexico, from all over the world
So, you don't feel that far from home, right?
Yes, yes
you have all that
Yes
Here at Idaho, we don't have any of that. Here the only music we had is a little Mexican, like
Yes
I don't know what it's called, but it's something like "Saltaditas" or I don't know what it is.
Aha
But it's music that I had never heard either over there in Chile.
No,
and of course, over there in Chile you listen to more music, I don't know, like, Boleros also and
Aha
things like that. But of course yo miss that here; because you don't hear it, you don't hear that much of that. And nobody comes here either. So you don't have a way of
sur-
Aha, aha
tain or anything like that. And I was missing it so much that no I'm listening to satellite radio.
Aha
And with that I have been able to, I have been able to remember now many songs in Spanish because after ten years I can lis- ten to songs that they are playing right now now
like that Regueton and all that
Aha, aha
I had no idea of that, because I hadn't heard music in Spanish since ten years ago
ohh, because now here in Chicago we have a radio station that is, nine hundred point one FM
and it's music in Spanish.
It plays Regueton. The whole day long.
Ah, nice
Aha, so, specially when I'm driving in my car,
aha
that you don't get bored because you play the, the radio loudly and and the walk is
Of course
faster, and it doesn't bore you, you don't fall asleep in the car, or anything.
Of course
Listening to music.
yes, it is, it is good to have music in Spanish because,
aha
because English is rich but it is not the same.
No, no
But it is not what you have grown up with or anything like that, eh
aha, aha, aha
yes, I am now happy with, with being able to listen to music in Spanish again, because it really makes a difference.
aha
On your mood and all that.
It is like music that, I don't know if you hear it, did you hear that they have eh, ah, when they are, you are waiting for a person
to grab the phone to talk?  I don't like that music, because eh, ah, it is music like, like classic and it is music like when you go
To see
like when you are on an elevator
Of course
That they have music. From, for me, for me
Right
It's not nice, and you should change it. Put Merengue or Bachata music, or the music
Sure
uh, like, like Cumbias, cumbias are nice.
And it would be cheerier, ¿right?
Right, right, right
Instead of getting mad, well, if you´re waiting so long, at least you'd dance in the mean time, ¿right?
Right, right, right, No, it's just, well, you fall asleep while waiting.
Yes.
Look, right now i was waiting like fifteen minutes. For, uh, to be communicated.
¿Seriously?
Yeah, the other time i was waiting for half an hour, and when i was going to be communicated to someone they hung up because supposedly it was eleven p.m.
And they hang up now.
¿Seriously?
Right, right, right.
My
¿How many times have you called?
Two with this one.
¡Oh, right!, I'm on this one
Yes
Its thirteen
Wow, Then you call, because i was waiting for a call.
ha
but then you can call and wait
no no, they will, they will call, yeah you can call, and then after five o'clock, you can call to any, oh after five.
who ever you want
oh, can you talk more than once a day?
no no, just once.
once a day.
yes
yes, last time i talked i talked with my sister, because we called at the same time.
ha
and my sister lives in Atlanta
ohh
and i talked to her, shes the one that does the recording for this show, when you hear a girl talking, saying what to do, and all that.
ha ha
she, she is my sister
ohh
so when she did the recording she told me to call so that we could listen and talk to each other, that was the only time i talked, then i didn't talk more, well
Ohh
So this is my first time talking to someone else.
Oh, blessed! You are missing a lot, if you are missing twenty-three.
Yes. So I put the batteries and so called, because I was waiting for someone to call me. But nothing happened.
Because again we are put to Policy.
Aha
But I call and get put on hold and nobody on the  phone, nobody, nobody.
It's scary, right?
But aha, but for me. My five in the afternoon, every afternoon I called. Here to, someone who
Ah, yes
that if I want to grab the phone to talk. But as I grabbed the phone, because I do not know what topic they are speaking.
Ahh
like this music. This is the second time I speak. me
Clearly
I've talked to many people. Nebraska, of Philadelphia of Miami
Ahh, I see
yes
No, I like the theme of music, more simple, the other time when I was a subject, clear of immagraciones, I think it was.
Oh, yes, yes, I speak
that makes me more afraid to talk politics and Migration
YEs
What happened, It doesn't say, I don't know
I don't like politics, but I talked about immigration, music and marriage
Oh yes
about cell phones, well, a lot of topics, figure out that I'm missing only 9 thanks to God
After the twenty or more then don't call any more, right?
After the 25, you wait two or three months and they send a check to your house
Oh, that's nice
yes
Okay, i should better start acting and start calling then
yes, after 5 PM you can call to anyone, you can call to the number you have
Sure
you have to call, and you communicate. But it has to after 5 PM, because at that time they change
the topic of what you're talking about, the topc
ah, okay, and each day is a different one?
Well, before, i talked like 5 times about marketing
Oh, 5 straight days
I talked with a girl 2 times about music, three about marriage and only one about cellphone, well a lot of topics
Oh
But, they didn't change the topics, but now that they placed a Lady to talk, well, they changed the subjects
Sure.
But first you have, has to talk well, much, the topics, almost always left the same topics, for the people speak.
Sure.
Look then, ah
Ah
You, ah ¿When you're leading, do you listen music or you not?
I do, I listen music too, but, I also hear, but a lot, it's been a long time since I left of listen music and start to listen
problems, converstation programs
Ajá
of Policy
Ajá
But is like after a long time you usually to that and forget of listen music and days go by without listen music.
Ajá, ajá
And then you realize that your music. I mean, the music really change the encourage.
ajá,
For the rest of the day ¿Doesn't it?
ajá,
So now, I listen more music for have more encorage and energy.
ajá
Because I don't know, will be for the Latin blood, I guess.
right, right.
But a necessity,
yes, yes, yes
It needs that. You know, that dance music, music that
right
yeah, because here I don't hear much of that music or style.
right.
you sure?
No, no Merengue, no Salsa, no Reggaeton, no nothing? Only Reggaeton?
No, I like everything now.
right.
Before when I was in Chile, I didn't like Salsa, Merengue, or anything like that. Now that I'm here, I love it.
right right, right.
Now all I need to do is learn how to dance, no more. But I love it.
Do you not, not, uh, watch TV when you are dancing?
No, they don't have it here. They don't have anything. Nothing Latino, nothing Merengue. Nothing at all here.
Oh no.
No, because there are very few Latinos here.
right, right.
The majority here are only Mexicans,
aha
but on TV, on the radio, there is nothing, nothing Spanish, nothing Latino.
No movies, or anything?
On TV no, nothing
No?
No, nothing.
Uh, ahm
So, we are in the middle of nowhere
Oh, God! Imagine
yes, it is boring
Uhh
Boring.  When I went to California to visit it was
Betsy, hi, ¿how are you?
I'm Tammy once again, fine, ¿and you?, oh my God.
I'm sitting here, let's see what can you tell me about the social security or whatever, because I have no idea
No, well here, i think that some things are good, but others aren't
Right, right.
Specially about the older people, they don't give them enough money, it's not about the money, but they need medical help, they don't fully pay for their pills
Oh
Then it's harder for them, you know, to take their pills because they have to think, "i have to pay for the pills or i have to eat"
Right, oh
Because they have to pay more and sometimes, sometimes there are also abusive people, i know some people that, well, they're not my friends, but i know they're abusing
Right.
Abusing people that really, that other people really need
Right.
right, but it's hard, i have my sister in law, my husband's mother
Right, right
and she has partial assistance, but no, they don't help her too much, and she has to, she has to search for coupons and stuff like that to see if she can buy her medicines in another place to make it cheaper or
buy this medicine this month or buy another medicine next month
Oh, that's horrible, right
Because she can't have them all, and that's bad, because if they don't take them like they have to
Right, no
they are not going to help you so that makes you scared
and and that is the welfare or pension or
yes that is, mja or welfare
oh or that is, aha, I imagine
assistance that they give them here because they don't give you much so it is difficult and you have to prove ehh show them that really
you have that but in any case if you do what gives you the thing is that if you are working
mja
and if you don't know they don't pay you well but you they pay you twenty dollars or a little more than twenty dollars from the
mja
or I think less than twenty dollars from the, from the limit they give you they don't help you
ha
I say because it is twenty dollars more from the limit they have but I say if that is not too much
OK
and they don't want to so they prefer that you don't work
aha
so they can help you but with the help they give you it is not enough for you to survive
but already but they don't pay you let's say all the medicine you need
no then that what they give you good thing they cannot they don't help you
aha
they don't want to help you because you make too much supposedly and too much is not so much, they cannot survive with that and you have to stop working for them to help you
and the help they provide isn't sufficient anyway there is
not so much, so it's difficult, i guess that is rather difficult for people trying to do that, that's why you have people who work under the table
aha, aha
because they cant's say what they do because afterwards they don't get enough help and they have children too that is another issue
but after eighteen years you don't get any help, when your children turn eighteen you don't get any help
no, no, i was standing one day and my son came the mad, came home and said to me, hey mother why don't you apply to the government so that i get lunches
mja
i say hey we do a lot of stuff so that you get lunches i think that i give you enough that you can buy launches and give him the paper
aha
four children, wait four persons in a house want you to make twenty four thousand dollars
aha
that isn't enough, a year, is not enough
twenty four thousand a year, oh my goodness for four souls no
four people no especially when you have a baby
aha
because that is, i say it's a lie, i was showing to my husband and i said to him that people is mad, where you work at and where you live because here where i live
mja
that is my son when he moved miraculously found an apartment near the place we live in like seven hundred twenty-five a month and that' cheap
mja but it doesn't include utilities
mja, no that it didn't had nothing of that so you can imagine and with the two
aha, oh, okay, that's clear
so, I say, if a person has four people at home and they earn twenty four thousand, they can't they can't
aha, it's not enough
so, to me, that's why I always talk to my children, be careful with your credit score, save money
aha, I see, don't waste it in things you don't need
because, aha, do you remember that I spoke to you yesterday?
yes, aha, he moved back in
my son is now back to our house, the older one moved back with us, he had a fight with his girlfriend and the girlfriend did something bad to  him and this man, my son, when you do something bad to him, he just waives goodbye to you and he will never see you again
boy
so, he took his stuff and my husband went there and helped him pick up his stuff and he left nothing in that apartment
I see
so, that's
that girl must  have done something pretty bad to him, mm
aha, very bad, this man, he called me on the phone and said mom and I told him that I was going to support him and so I told him to come back here and I'm going to try and get him to go back to school because
well, yes, when he moved out to live with his girlfriend, he had no job, oh, aha
yes, but now, I want him, well,  people in his job told him that he was allowed to go to school during the mornings.
aha
and work in the afternoon, they are helping him, so I told him that if he was moving back home, he would've to go back to school and that way I wouldn't ask him to pay me a rent
ah, that's good, aha
but, if you don't go to school, you are going to have to pay rent because, I want him to finish school.
yes of course, mja
because it goes, I say a lot of things specially with him if he doesn't want to finish school it will be hard for him to get stuff so I want
mja or to have a good career also they are not going to send him to work to a McDonald's forever
mja, so then, oh yes, yes because that is what I say to him because later something happens to you and you don't do it feels like you are going to finish asking for help and you are not going to get any, you are a man I mean
mja
it's not necessary he is so young to not finish his things we can help him here and he won't accept it
mja
I always put the example of the people we know, look you don't want to end up there, work hard
no, he doesn't want because he doesn't want to have, the government doesn't help him at all
mm, no yes and how it is over there in Canada with him, with this of the insurance
well here they make him work me when we got here from El Salvador which was fifteen years ago and we were given, we were leased an apartment
mja
bed and this couch and this but we were with the welfare
yes, mja, yes
for a few months there, because we would go to school and from there my parents got a job and my brother and I were in high school
and from there since my parents were working and they received help for my brother because he was fifteen years old I think
yes
and me already, and I already had eighteen and they didn't receive help for me, only for my brother but I got in high school and didn't work until
yes but they entered me in the welfare sometimes I would enter but I think that here they help you a little more because they give you a card for medicines
yes
mha, and this and you have to present it at the shop where you're going to buy the medicine and and they pla- pay well it was like that the last time that I asked for assistance
but now, ah now I don't know how it is, it must be harder
no, I don't know I we when my husband came out of, he used to be in the air force
aha, mha
so we arrived here and he neither they pay so much that was like in ninety two
aha
and then when we arrived here there wasn't enough to pay the rent so we got into it for a month
aha
to have enough to help us and for the time it took him to get a job, so it took him a month
that's good
well a month to get a job but you know the next check so we took that month and we got out right away from there but when you go to the shop with those, the one of these that they give you that are like fake pieces of paper
really?
people, yes when you go to buy that was years ago, so maybe now I think they give you a card
oh aha
but people look at you the wrong way
they look at you as if you're from another planet
aha that that yes because not because not because they are giving you aid you look like you can work, yes we can work but they didn't have and I was with two little ones I say I can't work right away because where would I live the little ones that I have to pay someone and I don't have money to pay them
mha aha yeah true
and then I told my husband never again, never
no
I say I work where there is before I'm stuck in that and always he has told me that I lower and I do not put my family that way
no
so that because it's like they look at you bad I say no man because you are asking for a little help
like what, mja
because no pu-no he left you those things fine or but it's very difficult
now of security them, they it happened the same and they look at you bad it's that way
uh huh, they don't remember, people don't remember that
mja
but I no I am not that way when I see people that have the need I say to anyone it could happen one day to another it happened to me
oh yeah of course
so that and good ah I say
because looking poorly upon people who have government aid, which really helps, is not a great thing
mja, well what I say, they are not stealing they didn't decide to go crazy and steal, they are
aha OK
they went for what they had to go and ask for help and maybe they didn't even want to do it but they had to do it
mja mja and that that it was like a little piece of paper that says that the government helps you and people know
mja
it is not money I mean they don't send you a check to your house or to your account
no no, ah eh which, which, well they send you a check
mja
well this was in ninety-two it is that I remember.  They send you a check and then they send you a little book
aha
little that they had like those of money monopoly
oh oh
and I made like five dollars, twenty dollars and you had to take it out from there and give it to the person and they didn't give you eh change back
oh no
it is that you had to try to have all that that was appropriate because what, I say no, I say that it is
and the government that, they did it to embarrass you
mja and then had to, they wanted to be sure that you don't use it on alcohol so that looks bad I say they should, I think that now with that the card they have
ah, mm, aha

Oh.oh, chico
But humidity wasn't high. So, it wasn't a very, very hot day
Oh
Because, what it have little effect here, not just temperature
Aha
but humidity. Then, we have, usually, I think so, I think about seventy, eighty percent of humidity.

You know, as soon as you left, you start to sweat. Because, it's like somebody is hitting you with a wet sheet.
ah
You know, it's very sticky and,

Oh
It's not dry because there's a lot of humidity.
Oh, boy
And I wash it in the morning, I go out and then I tie it up with a little bow, in a bow.
Aha. Ah.
So, my hair is wet all day long.
Oh, wow.
So, you know, it's not always the heath but the humidity, I believe.
Yes.

So, when do you, normally have snow over there?
What?
When do you normally have snow, when does it start to snow, when does the snow season begin and all that?
Ah, maybe, the other day, it was around eighty, no, seventy degrees. Then the other day we had around seventy but today, it's really cold. And it's not like that everyday.
the change, it changed a lot. Maybe today we are around sixty and then tomorrow we will have around fifty degrees you know, it's like that.
So, eh, but when does the snow season begin?

Well, the best each one can do, right?
Yes, sure, to go on vacations
Uh. Yes, to Mexico.
Right.
Only to Mexico and here and here in the United States I´ve been to different places.
And, uh, to
uh, on vacations, not work, on vacations
But yes.
Uh.
And where have you been in the United States?
In Texas
Right.
when I was in Texas I would travel from there to here
Mhm.
I have family here and there
Oh.
now that I´m here to, I´m going there or Nebraska with my bro-, my brother that is there
Mhm.
I also have family in Arizona, all my uncles
Right.
all, uh, almost all the family on the side of my mother is here in the United States.
Oh.
besides that, in other States, I have one in Wisconsin, so I sometimes go there too
Mm.
it's kind of close
Mhm.
so, what can I say? When you have time, you can travel by car, I like it, I like to drive here.
Aha.
because you can stop  along the way, whenever you want, to get some rest
Su-
with family, you've got to stop to rest
Mhm.
if you take the bus, it only stops once and it's pretty uncomfortable.
Mhm.
Just like that.
But, ah, when you went to Arizona, when you've been to Arizona did you go sightseeing or only to
Ah, Grand Canyon
Yes, did you go to the Grand Canyon?
Yes.
Aha, did you like it?
Oh, it's pretty.
Yes, yes.
Is very pretty, even though is very, like is a very desert area
Of course, yes.
but it has many pretty things.
Mm. And you have only gone to Mexico to visit your family or to visit other places also?
Well I have family in two states, in Durango and in Monterrey
Aha.
Oh, Monterrey has many oh, is, is like, what can I tell you? Well yes it has many tourist places, where you can go for a stroll, get to know
Mm.
is an industrial city, there are many well, what can I tell you? there are a lot of things that you can, there aren't, over there there aren't things like that but is very pretty.
Mm.
It has like I don't know exactly what they are, like rivers one is called the horse's tail
Mm.
they are like this huge, high waterfalls
Mm.
that, a lot of people from different parts visit it also
Mm.
is very pretty.
And would you like to visit any other country in the world?
Oh, yes, I would like to visit Alaska.
Alaska?
Yes.
Mmm...
Going to, to know what is the--
It is very cold there.
Eh, what the, exactly what real coldness is.
Mmm...
I would like to be there.
Yes, my, um... The boss I had before, went to Antarctica; I mean, the South Pole.
Really?
Yes, to see the penguins. Because penguins are only in the South Pole.
Yes.
And, ah... And she loved it. There are cruise ships you can take to go to Alaska; you take it in California and they take you all the way to Alaska.
Yes, I have known something about it.
And then you get to see all the glaciers and all the--
Yes, yes, I would really like to get to know that place.
Mmm...
But sometimes there is no time.
Ah, indeed, no.
And when?
Time and money costs.
when you have time sometimes you have no money
yes. Yes, it's difficult, no, it's it's, to me
What happens is
Aha.
as? Yes, tell me.
No, no, let me know where you were going.
Oh, what happens is, I tell you, like when you're on vacation, one, which then, well, at least I, ah, eh treatment
but go out where my family, going to visit my family at times ah
Clearly, mhm.
drive, two or three years without seeing them
Mhm.
I prefer to have a chance as well of course, seeing my family, walking also because it is not
Mhm.
Eh, us as we are very close, much less frequent
Yes.
and therefore better, there is sometimes you have to do better make plans to go see the family better
Clearly. yes, balance is difficult to see family and go on vacation but when you get married because then you have to go see family and tue
family of the wife or the husband
Oh, talking about that, that's another problem.
then there time is running out and the and the vacations and the money and everything, goes on that.
Yes, then better the time because the, ah, I'll tell you that I don't spend much money, when you go to see the family I don't spend much like when you go to
Yes, yes.
I don't know, that you're going to travel, to know different ah, cities or country
Mhm.
there yes you spend more because you have to spend hotels, food
Mhm. Yes, of course.
and, logical, you're going to know, where you want what you go you go spending money
Mhm.
to go out with the, to visit the family yes you spend, I don't tell you that no, but
Mhm.
you don't spend as much
Of course, yes.
it's very different.
Yes. Yes, I love to travel, I hope now that I start to work as a nurse and that I started to have money, to be able to travel
How good.
to the, to where I want to go, but yes, I, eh, I've been in Europe and, and I've been in Costa Rica and Guatemala I've been in Mexico but only in Mexico City
in Puerto Vallarta and in Chiapas
Oh, yes?
Ah, I was in eh in San Cristóbal and ah, where else was I in Chiapas? In eh I don't remember. But Ah, and I was in ah in Taxco too, when I was
Oh, Taxco
yes, when I was in Mexico
on vacation?
yes, I have a friend who loves to travel, she loves to travel, and to stay a lot in other countries, she just came back from staying two years in
in Taiwan, and when I met her in Mexico, she had been six months in Mexico, and then she was visiting the whole country
and i met her when she was in Chiapas, then we went to San Cristobal and Guajaca, and then we went to Taxco and we came back
I came back, she stayed
yes, I with vacation
Ah, from Ciudad de Mexico. Ah, well, she was studying
Oh
she was studying, then, what she did was to take the classes as an independent student, then while she was studying and taking classes, she was traveling all over Mexico
Hmm, that's nice
yes, yes, and then, when I-, ten trips with her, I spent almost nothing because we stayed in hostels, I don't remember how you call them
but, you can stay there, you stay there but you have to sleep in a room with a lot of people, no? but you pay, we didn't pay, we paid like
two dollars or three dollars per night
Hmm
but they're almost all students, I mean, you have to share the room with people you don't know, but
But at least you know you're in, with people, there is no danger, on the contrary, over there
no, yes, it's people that
they are, pe-
who is doing the same as
ah, exactly, people who are doing the same thing
They come to travel, yes, and they don't want to spend a lot of money, and then they stay like that, and uh, that was good, but I also went to Europe and I stayed a month in
traveling through Europe, but that was very expensive, but my parents helped me because it was my university graduation present, then yes, but after that when I was here in Houston
I've only gone to Aruba, which is in Venezuela's northern coast
Okay
Yeah. And it's, it's a little island like Puerto Rico but I didn't like it. It's a, a very famous tourist destination in the Caribbean, but I didn't like it.
because Puerto Rico is an island too, and Puerto Rico has a lot more green, and mountains, and this island, Aruba, it's a desert, there's nothing
absolutely nothing, they only thing is that the beaches are very pretty, but besides the beaches there's nothing else to see
Is it a desert there?
In Aruba, yes
Yes
It's really dry, there's nothing, absolutely nothing, it's really flat, and the only thing there are rock, it's really rocky
the beaches are rocky too
yes
yes, the sand is white, and the water is very clear and you can see through the water, it's a really clear blue
Look at that
but but, no, nothing else to do, absolutely nothing else
hmm
so, I didn't like it, because of that, but yes, I'm lucky that my whole family lives in Puerto Rico, except a sister I have who lives in Florida
the, the rest are in Puerto Rico but nove even like that, and now, for example, this year I went to see my sister in Florida and later in, in August
and after I went to Puerto Rico to see my family and now in December I am going to Canada to visit the family of my fiancee.
then thes is no more time or money to go to any other place
Well yes.
because they are, are three trips, three flights, I mean, no, there is no money left to go to any place then I believe after I finish the school and I going to take a
a free time, vacations before starting to work for
To rest.
Yes, or to, or to go to some place where I want to go, to a place that is different, no not to go to see my family.
Well that is good, because just starting working if your are just beginning and don't know how is going to be for you, well practically it is going to change your life rythm.
Mhm. Yes. Yes, and generally when you start working they don't let you take vacations for some time.
Mhm
there are places where the first three months you cannot take vacations and others where the first six months you cannot take vacations.
Look.
then, yes.  How is your baby?
Oh, very good, thanks
Yes. yes.  Growing.
Yes, that is good, growing, growind from the day he was born, he was born on Wednesday, on Saturday she had a appointment with the pediatrician, we take her
Aha. Aha. Aha.
and it gained almost one pound.
Aha
we were talking with the doctor, no? i was talkng with him awhile, he was telling us everything that its very good that he have fattend because many children
when they born in regular they tend to thin a little to lose weight
mmm
and this girl don't lose weight to the contrary he won weight
OK
yes its very well
yes
mmm, so i hope he keeps like that, and i don't have problems
yes, in the beginning they grow very fast
yes
very fast yes, until they have like two years after that begin, i mean they keep growing
Betsy, yeah... Oh, hi, Alex.
Ah, Betsy, you are indeed talking with Alex again. How are you?
I'm doing well, thank you, and you? That's good, mm...
Well, yes, well, the subject is travels.
Something interesting.
Yes, something interesting.
Better than poli--Than politics or whatever.
Yes, I've had many different opinions.
Yeah.
Well, do you want to start this time?
Sure, okay, well... If you did--didn't--if you did have money, a lot of money, and--and all the time in the world, I would like to go to Hawaii for, mmm... two months.
I suppose.
And, why?
Because I've never been there and, umm, the great--My husband's grandmother says it's very nice because she goes there every so often and I would also like to go on a cruise ship.
Is your husband Canadian?
Yes, yes he is.
Yes, a cruise ship would be fantastic.
Yes, a cruise ship, because I've never been--I've never traveled on a cruise ship before. And you?
Well, I once went on a trip to Spain
Yeah?
and to Gibraltar i liked it a lot but the south of Spain where all the beaches are
ah yes
eh those landscapes were beautiful
mhm
but i didn't had the money to stay too much
mhm
and that it always gave me frustration, if i only won a prize with all that money
mhm, yes
and the time too of course, when you have the money you need the money too.
yes
and then i would love to travel to Spain and visit the
yeah
there are lots of castles and interesting stuff there
aha
ah lot of things from the old world, lot of Roman things ah very interesting, knowing the history
mhm
but you need money, it's an expensive country especially if you want to travel
aha
yes and no, it isn't that dangerous from where i am, Columbia is dangerous
aha
One does not enjoy a beautiful country which is
Mhm
always in fear for the security of the country.
Yeah
no, Spain is better.
Ah, well, if there weren't that many soldiers I would like to go to Israel
dangerous
yes but no, without the war
yes
That's where I'd like to go
Columbia is a fantastic country if there weren't any soldiers
Yea
you have a scenery and some very big mountains
yes I can imagine already
yes and we also have a coast but the problem still is the army and the
Mhm
and the drug trafficking already damaged this country completely and the image that it has, I can imagine it's horrible
Yea
if what else ? enter United States if you like to travel or Canada.
in Canada, ahh I would like to go to Montreal
Yes I have listened that it is pretty but cold
here where we live right now eh the winter is rain just it
yes
where we used to live the winter was a lot of ice and was really freezing
Where do you live?
in the, near to Vancouver
not snow?
no
impossible
no because we are near to, we are already near to the sea
you are near to the north never falls snow?
well sometimes falls snow but it goes the next day
yes
and it does not get frozen, not not eh
because here in los Angeles never falls snow at least you go to the mountains
yeah okay here it is the same, here falls falls
yes
mm I really don't know once in three months something like that, maybe, yeah if it falls, falls
But if it falls should falls because Betsy is well north
yes
Yes, you're near Alaska
Yeah but it's, it's kind of fur because well, it's near the Pacific
Yes, near Seattle, Washington
Yes, aham
Do you know Seattle, Washington?
Yes uh, not so much, no
I'd like to know over there
I see
Yes, and also Washington, DC, I went to the capital once
Hmm, hmm
It has beautiful things, museums, history, I like everything about history and and one classical city is Montreal, Canada
Hmm, yeah two years ago
They say Canada is beautiful
Oh yes uh if you like winter, I mean snow
And no, there isn't insecurity as much as here in the United States
No, at least I haven't seen anything so ugly
Here at the States it's ugly
Yeah, magine
It's almost, almost like Latin countries now
Hmm
yes, that's why they critizise the immigration here because its a lot of immagration and theyre bad
now
and it has damaged the Country a lot
mhm
a a a throughout the years I've seen this country really go down and today in United States there is a lot of differences between poor and rich
mhm
this was not the case before, in canada, i think there is more balance
ehh
hay, there is not a lot of difference between poor and rich in Canada like here in the united states
there are a lot of poor people here
but there are more social pro programs there
but yes, yes that yes
and there is not that many people, the problem here is that there is a lot of people
mhm, m ya
yes, the country has gone down regretfully yes, a lot ahh
its been two years since we went to florida, Florida
yes and its drangerous
ya
they can rob you, they can do something there is a lot of misery its kind of like a Latin country no i don't see a lot of difference
mhm
Yes, and you know Latin countries are known for the difference between rich and poor people.
Yes, it's true, yes.
And that's how, that is how the United States is transforming.
Mmm...
Yes, but there... there... there is interesting stuff, and I once went to Texas and I liked the scenery, I-
Indeed.
I have always liked the Colombian plains.
Super hot.
Super hot, but very pretty.
Yes.
And the Texan plains look like that, a little more developed and I like the roasted meat...
Yes, yes.
And a lot of roasted meat was bought at places like that.
Yeah.
It is interesting; I would like to know more about Texas
Yeah...
Because of the scenery, mostly because of the plains-I like the plains, the plain, the cowboys-I like them.
The horses.
And the barbecues.
Mm, yes.
i love the roasted stake how they say in Colombia, the stakes
yep
and you encounter that allot in Texas
that's good, m
yes, yes i think the most interesting part in United States especially Seattle is known for it's coffee, they say it's a good coffee
Really ? real good, i didn't know that, m
yes yes
my parent will travel to el Salvador in November for two months
you have volcanoes there, yes
oh yes yes
i remember that there are really good views there
yes yes indeed and poor people too and
have security
almost no jobs, yes and
yes that is the problem of all the Latin countries they never managed to overcome
yes true indeed, mhm
yes hopefully one day could make L
yes some day yes
yes but i heard that vacations out there are beautiful for the volcanoes
yes if we had, mhm we already have
and mountains Do you know the beaches in Salvador> How are they?
yes, really nice, there is one called libertad and there is, there is another, a lot of swimming pools and the sea and very big waves
What are "olotas" Waves o what?
Here "ola" wave
because there is Pacific coast and also Atlantic coast, yes
yeah, wave, is not only Pacific, I think that it is only Pacific,
How many seas does it have? only Pacific
Yeah, same than here
yes
because Florida is the Atlantic
yes
mhm
because Colombia has the Atlantic and also the Pacific, Colombia has two seas
oh
that is why it is a really beautiful country, more beautiful than many countries
mhm, I imagine, yeah
as a country is the worse, but has a lot of beauty
ya
maybe, because it has many queens
oh yeah, the queen and the coke, eh no
But there are lots of bad things
Yeah that's true
yeah there's lot of thing, i don't deny it, one cant deny the truth about
yeah
about a situation, there are also bad things
I imagine
Not only that, there is also insecurity and um
mhm
and when somebody does tourism, one wants to go to a place that nothing bad will happen to them.
mm, that's true, yeah
Right? One wants to visit a place where there's not so much insecurity.
mhm
I'll tell you one thing that will frighten you
what's that?
I've never gotten robbed in Colombia
Really?
and i told you about spain, how they stole from me in Spain
really?
yeah, that's true
that's weird.
they robbed me in, in the underground train.
ha
they took my wallet
oh no
and they took like one hundred dollars.
wow and that was in spain.
yeah maybe more, how? in Spain
in spain, and not colombia
and in colombia where, its very famous for those things,
aha, ya
Rapone never happened because it is one of the reasons he was always most preventable
aha
and Spain when one is prevented
ya, mm ya that is right, mmm
yes yes, and also know that recently there was an act of terrorism there
in Spain?
If some trains operating, put some bombs and some people were Arab terrorism
aha, oh in Spain,duties?
and people died in Spain and this happened at the stations where I was
oh, aha, yes
few years ago I walked in those places where the act occurred
and that happened recently?
a year ago
oh
yes, then you know it, what it's going to happen if something bad
mmm
I will not go wrong no matter where you are
it is true, since, mmm
Goo night, I'm Joe
Hi, hello, Good night, where are you from?
From Colorado
From Colorado, and originally?
from Puerto rico
Oh, I'm in Idaho, and I'm from Chile
Chile, nice, How long have you been there?
in the United States, 10 years, in Idaho, three
10 years, oh, do you like it?, Do you miss a lot your home?
Yes, a lot. Well it's like Colorado, with a lot of snow
And it changes a lot, this season changes from
Of course
cold to hot, or from hot to cold?
Of course, and Puerto Rico is not like that, right?
Puerto Rico, it's almost the same weather all the year, but it has it's rainy moments and it's sunny days during the year
July might be really sunny and May really rainy
Oh, but no now
No, never
And how long have you been there?
Oh, I have been here many years, more than 20
Oh, fed up. And talking about travelling, Have you ever travelled to Puerto Rico?
Look, since 93 when my parents died, it was the last time that I went to Puerto Rico. But I have gone to other places, gone to Mexico
I have gone to other places, other places in the US also including Florida which is..
Oh yes
..one of my favorite places
Then, you have not always been in Colorado, you travelled. Oh you just travelled for holidays.
And for holidays to other States, there is a lot to see here, I don't know if yo had the chance to see other places here in the US
but there are lots of nice places
Oh no yet Not a lot yet, just Utah, and I don't know, just Utah, really, I went to Washington.
Washingon State, that is really beautiful over there
To Washington, Yeah. But not, not in the East of course.One day I hope to be able to
How did you land in Idaho?
Oh, to study
Ah
We came here after my graduation from the school to study at the university here.
Yes
Well, went to Utah, and there I met my husband and now we live in Idaho
Great
But. But we went back to Chile once five years ago and..
And
We hope we will be able to go back, you know, maybe next year.
And it's so difficult to travel around due to passport matters and so.
Oh not that much, but it's more expensive from Idaho, I believe, than if we were in Florida or California, I ..., Colorado is in the north, right?
Sure, it's more or less in the middle, we are a bit downer than you
In the middle. Oh, ok, then a bit downer, but more to the middle.
Yes it's a flight center, from here there are many flights to southamerica as well.
Oh, then it will be a bit easier to travel.
Yes, if I decide to spend my vacations in Cancun, for instance
aha
and went there for three days with about three hundred and fifty dollars
oh no, really?
that would include flight and hotel acomodation, yes
Oh sure, that's why we never go to any place, because only the eh.... anything will cost about three hundred dollars or so. Each ticket, it's very expensive.
Probably it would be easier for you to go to Washington. Or go to a most centric place and fly from there to elsewhere
Yes, have you ever travelled abroad, like to Europe or something like this? or you never ahd the chance?
No, I would love to go to Europe. My two brothers, one lives in Wichita, Kansas and the other in Puerto Rico, they do travel a lot.
Really?
They've been all over Europe, and they have told me how beautiful it is over there, Paris, Sapin ...
Which country, which country would you travel to if you had the chance?
Well I would like... one of my favourites is Australia
To yes, to Australia.
yes and I would love Australia because it is rather exotic there and also New Zealand.  But I would also like to visit Italy, Spain, France, all those places, but I believe that the number one for me continues to be Australia.
yes Loo, yes for me, if I could choose, I think it would be Italy.
Italy yes, Italy is beautiful.
Yes, I don't know, to Italy, yes I believe that Italy.  But Australia, it is huge, Australia, there is so much to do.
There is a lot of history, yes well I, I worked for a company where the president of the company, he is an Australian, and owner also of the company, then there we became good friends and all that,
And he always invited me to go there, but I have a five-year-old daughter, I am a divorced dad.
oh,
And I have shared custody.
And of course.
then,
oh, then you are going to be,
I would never abandon, I would never leave behind.
of course.  At least for another fifteen years, no.
yes, yes when she forgets she has a dad, and and she starts thinking more about boyfriends, yes
Of course when she no longer wants anything to do with me, for a while, no
yes yes but until now, well I am crazy about her and she is crazy about me and,
Of course, no now it is difficult.
we have a great time.
Yes we have small children, also and that makes it difficult to travel anywhere.
yes exactly. Well, I want to go to Puerto Rico next year so that she gets to know her Puerto Rican half, because her mom is Mexican,
Sure, ah.
so I want her to know that, and she's crazy about going and to see her grandma. Her grandma comes here every year and they get along really well, they have good chemistry between them,
ah, so you're going to take her there, but at what age more or less are you thinking of taking her,
she, well, she has traveled many times by plane,
aha
ah, she has traveled more that I in the last three years because she goes to Mexico with her mother, at least twice a year.
A look, so she's constantly.
Oh, she's very used to traveling, she's very quiet, I'll tell you that once we were traveling, well it wasn't, it wasn't by plane, but when I travel to Wichita
mhm
I went once by Greyhound and it was a horrible experience, because she was still very little. And when she got on the bus,
Sure.
She was asleep, but when she woke up completely, she panicked
I can imag-
I think that she though that she was having the worst nightmare. And people there were very uncomfortable, and they told me things.
Sure
And it was a very bad trip, but,
Oh, yes I can imag- how old was she?
she was about two then
Oh, tiny, she didn't understand yet, of course.
and I promised her that never again going to take her in one of those buses , we call it bus
aha
then, then, next time we went on a plane, a small plane, we had a good day, and she was very happy, Not to mention that it was only
an hour's flight, compared with thirteen hours by bus
ah, yes, that's much
yes
no, but good that she likes to travel, because, so she will want to travel after because there are people who really do not like traveling and y can't believe that
it was horrible
they do not like traveling
I would love to see the entire planet if I could
sure
I love to travel as much as possible, but actually, it's hard for me because of the economic situation
sure, and we have to take responsibility for the children
yes exactly
set foot on land for a while
yes, exactly, yes but, has, if given the opportunity to go to other parts, come to Colorado because is very nice
I heard it is super slow
is beautiful, come here
many forests, no?
has many national forests, many majestic mountains, a lot of places of attractions in the city. a lot. have a bit of everything. but if you come here to the mountains and go to sites that are great you will see that beauty, like you're in paradise
How long have you been living there in Colorado?
I've been living here twenty six years.
wow
In December it'll be twenty six years, yea. Well yea, I came right here, well I stopped for a bit in New York for a short time.
mhm
So I came here with my ex- first wife.
mhm
So we were married for about ten years, and then each one went their own way.
ah, and she was American or, where was she from?
But uh, she's half Puerto Rican and half Swiss.
ah,
she was my, my high school sweetheart
oh yea,
yes well we got along well, and it ended well we just realized that we had different goals in the end.
right, well it's that a person changes a lot, right.
You can change a lot, yea, yes.
in those years.
The girl's mom, well it was a really short marriage.
Right.
It didn't even last two years.
ah yes oh, and that one her, is from Mexico
Yes she is from Oaxaca Mexico
aha
But we have a good relationship as parents with the girl.  We work very well toghere with her.  In fact today we went to her school to the kindergarten.
mhm
then let's see what the teacher used to say to us, and the teacher gave a, good report on the girl, because my girl is a very good girl, she has a good heart, and
she has a voice so sweet that everybody loves
what strange, no yes, she is very nice
She has, she behaves very well, she is very respectful it is a, she has a lot of love for God ans she has, you know, good principles and she is hungry for learning
now where does she live?
in, you mean my ex wife?
aha, with the girl
she lives very close from here, I live in Aurora, Colorado y she lives three miles from here
ah, then you can see her frequently
yes, I see her three times a week all weeks.  More in other activities like today for example, well
ah, look how nice
we shared together with her
look how good
yes, that is good
And it is going to be nice, now when, you are from Puerto Rico and you don't have any problem coming in and out of the United States, right.
Not at all.
I've never understood why, what role does Puerto Rico play to the United States because it is not a state. it is a separate country, but at the same time.
Well it was invaded by the Americans in 1898.
aha
it started when the Spanish settled there, then governed by Americans, and from there it was under control until they started putting Puerto Rican Governors in charge,
as in 1950, fifty-four, they gave the Citizenship to all Puerto Ricans.
oh, not so long ago
But Puerto Rico, it was not so long ago. For example my parents were not born there as citizens. but I have been a citizen all my life.
clearly
in, then thereafter Because it emerged that the commonwealth has a free Association with the United States without being a state.
Beyond the primary vote, the vote beyond the primary for president here, but not voted by the president for elections from here.
So in some ways they're independent, in some ways they have a lot.
oh
A, dependence, or union with the United States would be very difficult for Puerto Rico to make a fully independent country because
independent.
it would have to be approved first there and it has never been approved, nor does it have approval
Good evening, Mildred from Connecticut.
Hello. How are you? What's your name?
Mildred.
Mildred, I'm Arturo.
Where are you from, Arturo?
Um... I'm from Mexico, but right now I'm in Philadelphia
Oh, okay, we have already spoken, haven't we?
It might be.
Sorry?
I think so, I don't... Where are you from? Puerto Rico?
Yes.
Yes, I have spoken with you.
Puerto Rican, mmm...
It was my turn to talk about... I don't remember what-Wait, I do remember now, it is the music.
Today it is the music.
Yes, the music is good, isn't it?
Do you like it?
A lot.
Mmm...
Do you play an instrument or-
What type of music do you listen to?
Well, everything, music, jazz, a little bit of classical music but I also listen to a lot of, I don't know, this popular music, and also alternative and fusions like
Fusion of jazz and funk
Rock and all this, ah
You listen to a little bit of everything
Reggaeton and all that
No, do you like Reggaeton?
Ah,
Do you like Reggaeton?
Yes, I yes, I listen to everything.  Reggaeton, rap, everything.
Yeah
Rock, I don't like- I hear it but I don't like it for a long time, for a little bit okay, but a whole night listening to rock, no
I'm not really a rocker
No, I am, I'm really a rocker.
But if the bachata, merengue, salsa, all that's music, classical music.
Yes
Romantic music, nice, yes, I find that if all the towns know the music, they know people in all different countries
Yes, yes, but
and
recently I think that this has lost also how music now is so mainstream like for example the hip hop that now, everyone in the world is making the same music.
in the united states, in mexico, in every wave, they are only imitating, like if its turned into something global.
The whole world, listens to it, i don't really like it, but I've  seen how the how world is adapting to hip-hop
inside music, i think its like regueton, therea a big change as well.
ha ha
in mexico, Mexican music is using lots of hip hop, and there are more rock banks that use hip hop.
i think that if lots of people, even if their different nationalities, there are Mexican people that like salsa, there's people that
yes
that are from different countries that like salsa, merengue, yea, bachata, when ones dances it.
yes yes
oh
i like dancing merengue and salsa as well.
there's so many countries dancing it
yes
I like Mexican music because it has a good rhythm, specially in northern music, i love them. yes
yes, northern music
i like them a lot
yeah, they're good, i like them too, but sometimes i dont, i want to learn international music like,
I've heard, music like arabian music, or turkish music once
yeah ha
its interesting, its good as well.
yeah very beautiful, very beautiful, and the Chinese too, chinese music
yes yes
yes, especially i mean if one knew how to interpret it it would be more beautiful because they're almost always eh, presenting like histerically when presenting, their presentations with the women moving their hands
yes, and the fans
yes, yes yes, yes
they use it like, like to tell a story
aha, well then everyone like tells something with the music too i mean in every way the music that has no lyrics it's still telling it's painting like an image i mean like
like a scenery, it has lyrics then it's always like telling something or relating to a feeling or a history, i mean the be- the Mexican music like the corridos
are very well known because they tell stories don't they, of different people, of different things that have happened, but they're histories well very original, very good some times
then, without arri- going to previous times, Indians did their, their
yes
their dances and everything, and they were and the, the slaves were the first that used the music to to, like to explan, like to be able to say
yes
how bad they were treated with that they expressed all their, their
aha
their discomfort
yes, yes, yes
i think that the music will always always go on centuries and centuries and it will always be there, you know
of course
even if it's different, on the uh, on the kind they choose, they're always going to unite people because wherever you go, well you listen a reggaeton and you already know who was it, and sometimes
yes ja
I do not know id you remember there was a Japanese band the light band
yeah
they started to play
no,no that yes
yes and they were Japanese and they were here a long time, I do not know what happened to them lately but they used to play a lot in New York,a no,they did not have original discs but they played of these
same salsa discs they made the music in Japanese
Japanese oh
O I am sure if a Japanese came to America they would say well i heard that song
no, I never heard them.
although I did not understand what they say but,
sure
mhm I believe the music is beauiful and relaxing
yes yes also
one uses it to relax
very relaxing to enjoy
I have records even from coqui from Puerto rico with that music that they tape in the river.
ah
for one to relax
yes
When you want to spend some calm time at home, you can light those little scented candles and relax, that helps a lot
yeah, yes, like pure environmental sounds, or that are
hmm, yes, and you need music, you need it because maybe if we didn't have music people would be like
even a little more aggressive too
yes, no, because music is
because music has a calming effect
even music that's, uh, aggressive can help you blow off some steam, also music can be very important for venting, just like
there's a singer that's called, there's afrobid music, his name is Cela Kuti and this man, well, for him Nigeria's Civil War
it was very important because him, with all his music, he made the revolution's movements, I mean, people didn't see him as a musician, but as a political leader
yeah
that, he moved people through his music, then when he released new CDs
hmm
the, the army got mad, and sometimes he, he had a whole community of, like followers, who had the same political philosophy he did
and they all lived together in communities, and then he released a CD called Zombi, criticizing the army, because they were like a puppet of the government, that were
like killing their own people
oh
he said all these things in his song, and the army heard it
and, how do you say it, they extradited him from the country, they, they
yes, yes, they kicked him out, they, they put him in jail and beat him up, and burned his house and all
yes, because it was what they call protest music, right
exactly, the music
In Puerto Rico they had el Topo, el Topo, and who did sing protest song too? Juan Manuel Serrat did sing protest songs. And sometimes when they made concerts they didn't want to let them do it, you know
Aha, yes of course
Because as they sang the truth, about the working class
yes is yes
Against the government and all that, they
People were rioted a lot and the government dislike it
They tried to boycott it and that people didn't attend it
yes
but is interesting because that tell stories
yes it clear that it is engraved in History aswell, the music will always reflect what is people living and what is thinking at the moment
mhm yeah, I agree, I think that
yes, so good
As, I, I tell you, I think music is very much needed
yes, always
Tell stories about love. tells disgraces, tells people troubles
yes
the daily life is used to a lot of things
yes, yes all mhm yes, yes, yes I think it's is essential, as essential as air. I think we couldn't live without
yeah, I think that, I love the music I think that when, when I put it on, I clean the house faster
and yes, do you play music? Do you play any instrument?
No, you see, I always liked piano and my daughters took some piano lessons but I really never had a chance because my mom had no money to pay for piano lessons for me
yes
I like guitar and harp
oh, harp
Harp, it's an instrument, it's not that used now but I really like it
yes, it's not that, in fact, I used to have a friend in school that played the harp, really beautifully, yes
harp sounds beautiful. I like, I also like accordion music, I like it too.
yes but yes, like you said, Mexican music uses a lot of accordion sounds
aha, now, in Puerto Rico, they use it, the people, it's what we call gicaro de campo, when people go out to party in Christmas they use it
yes, yes, yes
But you don't play any instruments?
I play the guitar and I tried playing the bass for a while but it was really hard, I couldn't, I wasn't able to
so I stopped
My boyfriend plays bass, well he used to play it, not any more, he's older now
aha
but
yes
he used to play in a band and in orchestras, he used to play the bass
it's always good to play music, I believe
Mmh
it also helps me to blow off steam when, when I want to get distracted and then well I grab my bass and play a little, and
OK, it relaxes you
I distract myself, it relaxes me
OK that is good
yes
that is good.  I lea- here we have many
mmh
because he, he does ~DJ~
ah
he does ~DJ so, there is music all over the house
ah, OK
and then, he is on the internet all the time recording discs and
yes
and we make discs for people if they want
aha
sometimes we have done parties and we make it is what he records a ~dc full of songs and we give it to the person.
yes
aha
to parents hes my uncle does something similar, I mean he, also he was like ~dj
OK
but now he doesn't work much in that, he is doing other job, but he also record
Goodnight, I am Joe.
Goodnight, Cristina, from Idaho
How are you Cristina?
I am well, where are you from?
I am from Puerto Rico, but I live here in Denver, Colorado.
Ah, how many years do you have?
Oh, I have a lot. I have about twenty-six years here.
Oh,
Yes, and you?

Yes, you have a little girl don't you?
Yes, a little girl five years old.
Oh, yes, yes I remember. How is your daughter?
Well well, growing, getting very nice and sweet.
You have to be careful with the kids.
Oh yes. Really, so little and she tells me whe- she asks me when can she have a boyfriend. I tell her, it's going to be a very long time my little child before that's possible.
Like when you're twenty five years old, no
yes, more or less. I could be.
And li-
That, speaking of tonight's topic,
yes, How is Colo-, how is where you live? In, is it a big city, or do you live in the city, or do you live outside?
Well, Denver is a city that's considered big, but eh, w-
Ah
I live in Aurora which is next to Denver
Aha
it's also a city, and it's fairly well populated, but it doesn't have the highrises as Denver
Ah, and it's a bit quieter
I wouldn't say it was quieter, I would say it was
Ah
because, it has a mix of everything,
Hm mm
of good people, of bad people, of all ethnic groups, there are, crime is fairly high here, and on lives it seems with a bit of fear.
Hm mm
So, yes, I used to live in a house before. Now I live in an apartment, and, and, I have found several nasty situations around here.
Really?
including shooting and thing like that
Oh, and, and would you like to move, to move, where would you like to, what kind of place would you like live in?
Well, yes, yes, if I could leave, I would like a place that is much more peaceful, in a town.
oh,
because I am really tied of the city. In fact, I drive here everyday, in the traffic in Denver is horrible.
It must be.
Too many cars, too many, and and where I live my daughter, ah, where she goes to school, well it's really far, sometimes in the morning it takes me an hour and half to drive, before going to work
Wow
yes, a little bit, once you get to work, you are already under stress
You have a headache, right
And you have a headache, yes.
What a difference man. Here is very peaceful.
yes,
Very, very peaceful. Eh,
Is it a town?
Is good. Idaho, the state of Idaho is very peaceful, eh, Country I would say
yes
I mean, the city is much bigger, is Boyce
yes, over there yes.
That's why is a peaceful city.  And, and is more or less a small city.
Yes
And that's the biggest city. After that I think it's Idaho, Idaho Falls, but, I think it's like a big town
yes
Because it's not a city, it doesn't have any big buildings, or things like that
yes
So, there are ones like this one, which is a big town, but..
And how is crime and those things?
Oh, nothing happens here. Here people lives with open doors, open cars
Oh, that's nice
And
In Auroram things don't work in that way
Of course, it's really quiet. In the news, they daily talk about someone missing something, I mean, nothing happens here
If something ever happens, it would be like the news of
They are not related to crimes or something like that
of course, of the month, no, nothing, absolutely nothing
Wow, that's really, really nice
Sometimes it's just to quiet
I'm moving right now, to be your neighbor
Yes, it's really quit. And people, a lot of them live in the countryside
It's the complete opposite of Denver
Eh, yes
and Aurora. Aurora
Like I say, it's too much, too tranquil. There is and there isn't much to do, here the people that live here they like a lot of things outside like
yes
camping, fishing, and going to the mountains to ski and
No the people in Colorado also. Eh, mm, eh, here n-mm we like to go to the mountains, of camping, of all that
Ofcourse, well
but here there are people from all different places and
Of course
make places that that the people have come from, they have brought many bad habits also
of course
So, well things happen that, one lives in terror,
Of course
with my daughter I always live in fear, because there is much always they speak on the news about crime happening in Aurora
Of course
That yes, the shootings, the robberies that, that they run over a child, and that the driver went on the run
Of course
Things like that
Like a city-like a city city, well
Excuse me?
We I lived in, when I lived in Chile I lived for a while in Santiago, which is the capital.
yes
And of course, it is, it si different to live in a city.  I mean you don't leave open doors.  You don't- you don't trust anybody, generally.  And
And cars, and the cars here you leave - CDs,
Of course
or anything because they break the crystal, to steal them
Everything
the -CDs, and
If not everywhere, but
I never leave anything that calls attention to my car.
Of course No, here it is really quiet.  To me, eh for me it is too quiet, but it is good, because since I have children, it is good to raise children and all that.
Ay, that's great.  I dream about a place like that.  The only thing is that like
Because of that
I have, and I am a divorced dad, my daughter
Of course
She and I have, eh I mean, we- my ex-wife and I have shared custody
You have to be near
yes, I, I would never want to leave my daughter behind.  I want to stay with her here until she grows up,
Of course
and she told me one day, oh dad I am going to get married, and she forgets me.  I hope not, but I know that sometimes that happens.
Well spend a lot
yes
But nothing, I would like if you live in a quieter place. My brother lives in Kansas.
Aha
and very little calm over there, too.
Of course not.
We do festivals, people are Not calm.
A little more relaxed.
Yes, there are many beautiful things. here is not ugly or anything, but
Of course
is that because so many people living there and more people moving, and, and the city is, there are cities in Colorado are among the most growing throughout America,
Clearly
eh, that too has its problems
if, and that's what I miss. Because here there is not much to do. Apart from the things you do outside, there's no opera, no, uh, places to
The mall is very tiny, no places to visit, or places, ballet, concerts and stuff. there are no such things here.
Then one more city, you know, as I say, a City that is in Utah
yes
and, and, if you like to do things like, going to concerts, or going to see you kno an opera, theater, or anything like that, a show
no, no, you have to drive about four hours, three hours, to see something. Nothing much happens here. The only thing is that the universities here have such chiquititos show, I stuff, but
that is missing from the city
yes
that you can find that type of fun but, at the same time it's
No, it's the opposite here. Here you have the
ah, with peace of mind and all that. Ah, I used to like that a lot, when we lived in Utah
yes.
ah, in City it's like a city that has all you want
yes
and it's quiet
And the, well the, the many parts around here it's quiet. And there you have all sorts of attractions for the family,
Sure
for adults, for singles, everything. In truth there are many things here in fact, where I work, it's a zone with many high tech companies of
aha
so, also, there's even an amphitheater about a block away from where I work, and sometimes we hear concerts from where I work.
Sure
From the building
yes, you see that, I would like to be near something like that, that would have more activities and things like that.
yes, or, no, that is not lacking here. The only thing is that sometimes the, it's particularly in the city where I live, that there is too much crime here. I would like
there are other parts of, of right here, the border zones of of that are fairly quiet and
Hm mm
and good neighborhoods. Even thought they have many people, but they take good care of each other. And, and as you say they keep their cars open, and they are not afraid that they would be robbed or anything like that.
Of course
In this, that is, like the limit of, is a mixture of bad and good.
Of course
understand, and the smug, well the are the ones that like to take advantage
Of course
And you like like in fear, and, peaceful
Of course
But, the traffic is horrible, let me tell you
But, I do not miss
Is is horrible. Because sometimes the taxis during winter days, is even worse. Because, when these accidents start, you can't move in the highway.
oh, the snow, the ice and everything, oh
is terrible
Oh, that is one thing I do not miss at all
But, i always dream of a peaceful place. Someday I think that or rather, is going to be possible. In, in
Well, yes well, when is, when is and the time where your daughter lives, she lives close also, right?
She lives very close.  Like one, not even two miles away from here.
Oh,
In what is my house, mm. And also from my ex-wife's house, well that used to be my house, they got in also. Once, they broke in by the
the, because the house  has three levels
yeah
And the, the like the basement, like that, like that is not a basement.  That had windows above.
Aha
Then, they came through the back part and in the basement, I mean the lower part and they stole a bunch of things from her.
Oh, they were not at home, though?
No, she had gone with someone from work.  I went to the house, and examined, and advised her that she had to block this and that so
they are not left exposed to criminals, really.
Of course
Then she did it like that.  Also her car, at work, where she parks is not a very good area.  And they have, they have broken in to the car like three times.
Oh, such anger.
Three times they have broken the glasses, they have- they have stolen her -CDs, they have stolen the stereo.
That makes me angry.
OK yes, eh, that is the bad thing about living in the city.  You have, all kinds of attractions but also there is a lot of
Of course, you have to
disadvantages
you have to be careful.
I miss
Of course, here you relax.  And that is the problem, because, we need that comes, you know on the other side, and that you take care advantage of circumstances.  People trust too much.
Exactly
and they relax and all that.
Listen, you have
And,
sorry, continue.
Oh, for example, when this happened, here it was major news, here at least, a man who came and, and killed a family and took two children.
Oh, I remember about that.
Yes. And because precisely, living here in the country and the children, one never imagines that something like this is going to happen around here. And
Yes
And,
Yes, crime can happen anywhere
Of course.
That's sad, that you
And you have to be careful, always.
Yes, and don't be too trusting of some people, strangers in particular.
Of course, that's the way.
I, I always teach my daughter not to trust strangers, and to be very careful.
Yes, but you realize that when you have children, you start worrying about all these things, ah, it's terrible.
Yes, and you start to teach them not to touch here or there, and
of course, when you don't have children, at least you take care of yourself, right? But
Yes
Yet having children, and no.
Hello, good afternoon
Hello? Good afternoon. What?
This is Maira
Ah, Maira, What's going on? it's Jose
Memo, are you Memo?
hi? um?
Who are you
It's Jose
Oh, Again?
yes, again
How are you?
good, and you?
very well, how is everything? How are your classes?
Oh, well, Here I'm studying a little bit and then they called me and I say well, why not? why don't I rest a little, right?
good.
and, how are you? how are your classes?
Me? good. everything is good, I finished all my exams, this is the week in which you can't do anything
uhum,uhum
and well, it's only the weather I'm telling you I do not get used to it and it puts me in a bad mood
oh, no
I swear that I in the morning I turn the window and I, I get angry again.
No, but, but, where are you from? where do you live?
Ah, I'm in the high-rises, aha
eh, before coming here?
yes, where?
Ah, before coming to, to study here?
No, no, no, no. I lived, before coming here, I lived in, in lived in Singapore for two years. And before that I was in Mexico City all my life.
Ah, ah then it is there
yes.
yes, it's very hot. Or it's hotter than here
yes, well yes. I have gotten used to, to the tropics.
Singapore is very hot, right?
Then, it's tropic, like that, no, not more, then.
yes.
yes, i arrived and it was like today today, what's going on?
ah, and then eh yes, it's cold and
yes.
eh
And in the air that it rains for a week, I don't understand how they can survive this time
no, it's cold and yes, yes, there's no sun. Ah, yes, I know after the summer it's nice. But a, a, a week like that, with a bit of cold and of
so that, uhm, ahm, not much like that.  I like that but ahm, yes, one knows that it is only the beginning.  right? of a terrible winter
yes.
Then, ah, but that, that is what strikes me the wrong way, but
yes, yes, yes.  And what happens is that the cold, if you can put up with it, like let's say until December, Christmas passes and then when, what happens is that
when you come back, you think yes, well, Christmas is over. So you then say, the cold is now, now, over.
Uhum.
The cold is for Christmas and that's it and you come back and it is worse.  That is when it really hits me, I stay like that like that like oh no
Oh
that's it, that's it please.
yes, I know,type, my, my brother studies in, in, in Cornell. That is like much more to the north, it must be around six hours from Philadelphia, but it is
much more to the north
yes
and over there it is so cold that the classes don't even start until, until the end of January, until maybe the twenty-eight of January or
Oh come on, seriously?
yes, yes, because wehl, he says that here it is so cold that for, me, we better stay more days in May that spend here the days in January, really?  The students.  Because, it is that
Oh come on, aha
they are, is that the, the cold in Cornell is brutal the one in Philadelphia, at least one can take it, right?  The one in Cornell is, is too much
Oh, that is unbearable
And my brother
And I was thinking of going there.  That is good that I didn't go, because I would not have survived.  I swear that I would not haev survived.
Right, no it's that and my brother, uhm well, he was lucky to, to be given a, what they call a town houses
Uh huh.
but that, that it was much bigger, then one went in and they had a first living room downstairs and kitchen, and then one went upstairs and there were all all their rooms but
it was quite big, but the problem is that they were some of the new university dormitories
Ah.
and they had built it on on the, on a, on the outskirts of, of  the university, so it was at a really far end of the university. And his lectures
they were of engineering that were on the other end of the university.
Ow, poor guy.
And, and he said that that and also he is oh, it's that I say no, right? Then I tell him but I say ha, there's, there's a bus system there of, of
of public transportation there, why don't you use it? No it's that I don't want to pay the fifty dollars, you understand
Oh.
right so in the end, he spent the whole semester walking and And in winter, it was, I don't know twenty degrees and h- he walked forty minutes to get to class, it's that
oh, it's that my brother
Ow, poor guy.
No, no it's that it's
He asked for it.
But it's because no, no that yes, it's that he's cheap, right? he didn't want to pay the fifty dollars then he said. yes, I, it's that that's ridiculous then he said
no because the bus only goes by once every four times every hour, so he doesn't want to wait fifteen minutes it's a thing like that.
Oh.
Oh, it's that my brother, I don't know
In what year is your brother?
No, but um, he's in third year now.
Ah, O.k
Yes, yes, but
It's ok.
And, and what do you think about the crime here in Filadelf?
Of what? of the crime?
er, of the crime, yes.
I haven't heard much here in Philly, I heard that some people got robbed in the forty one or whatever.
Uhum.
But I think that I've had good luck because I've been walking alone in the night on the forty one and I like to go shopping.
In the stores that sell fruits on the forty eight and I go there when I want and nothing has happened to me.
And you walk to the forty eight?
Yes, alone. enchanted about my life,in addition, I'm not even scared of anything.
Oh.
and nothing has ever happened to me, I've had no reason to panic or get scared, on the contrary, everyone is very friendly when I go there.
Then, I don't know, i think that
yes,yes
I think I've had luck because in Mexico it's the same. All my friends in Mexico has a history of robbing or kidnapping or something else that happened to them.
And nothing has ever happened to me, I'm always alone in the darkest hours of the night on bad places, and everything people tell you not to do.
Uhum, uhum.
All of that I have done at the same time and nothing has ever happened to me.
To the
yes, yes it is like that I swear that, that mm I see what I have done, yes, I remember what I have done, and how did I dare?
What was going on?  I sure was an irresponsible teenager bu, well nothing has ever happened to me
Ehm
So, I don't know, I don't, I don't feels necessarily so insecure, because I don't have many reasons.  But you? you do know Philly
Mm, well, I don't, to well to me
Oh, yes, how was it?
to me is is the, them, with me it is almost the same story, right? because nothing has never never happened here to me s-, but of course that I live
here, close to the university, I live in Walnut and thirty-eighth between, between, between the thirty-eighth and the thirty-ninth
Aha
Thn, it is not very far and here there is a lot of safety and then but in general I, I don't know anybody either that, that have done nothing to, is that seriously, I think that
of course if happens, right? In by turn you see it, it in the newspaper and one
yes.
but in general it is pretty rare, because in, in these areas there is so much security ehm and they have cameras
yes, too
and, and lights, and they have those phones, and they have the people, the, the, the police that ride a bike that it is incredible what they, what they have to
and they spend a lot of money but also it i-, it is like in general, they maintain it pre-, pretty safe
yes, yes, there is a lot of it
i imagine that the people of this neighborhood, by example, or the criminals know that there is so security that they have to be careful really?
it seems to me that there are many times that it can do with the criminals, so i don't know its pretty safe in general and now
in the Quad they have of those because the security wasn't so strict before, you had to pass and gave your card to another people
and then they passed what did they call? the system that to see if you really were a student or were not
that you were not falsified the card and then you pass right? but now
OK
but another thing is that the people get out and was very easy to get in. But now they have those sistems with new doors that
you cant do anything right? then they worry very much for the university in general
yes
heh
yes, in general, like in Philadelphia there are zones that i don't dare to go yet
yes
i don't like it, i mean in the night the center city there are some places that i dont like to walk
no
but i don't know, maybe because i dont know very well the city or i dont know the people here
yes
i mean, in Mexico if i see somebody i know if i go near to him or cross the street or not
mmmm
and here is like that so i don't know, i know whom i have afraid and who not
yes, yes
Well no, no, no
Well Philadelphia has many dangerous neighborhoods because
yes.
eh, they have, and the neighborhood is really safe, right? so then you have here, the one of the university which in general is also very safe but
say it you go to the north, like in North Philly all that and South Philly and West Philly and well is not necessary but more
in other words only that gets very, very dangerous. So, but also, for example if you are going to go out at night you are not going to go out to North Philly, so then is not so
so important, right?
Mm.
for us.
yes, also.
yes, because if, if you are going to go out, if you are going to Philadelphia, but that you go to Old City but then in Old City there are so many people that go there that they even have police there and everything
then
Listen, so then you don't know anyone in Philly that has a history of, of that they've stolen anything from.
yes, eh, yes, in general, well also there are not that many students that go to Old City usually the students are, they stay here, in the university.
Mm, Okay
I think. Eh, yes, well generally. But people complain too much that there's no security here that we are in a bad neighborhood and
but generally is, is that yes, every week you read the, the -D -P so there is, there is, one time that
that there was, an assault or whatever, so then you naturally think that is, that is happening a lot, right? but
Mm.
in, in reality is a, you think well maybe they assault, or rob I don't know two hundred students, but there's like twenty thousand students, so the probability that the
what, what if it happens to one
yeah that too
of course it exists, right? but its not so high
of course, apart from that its also not that rare for that too happen, you may be walking and then
yeah yeah
43, just like that, they cant always do that.
yeah yeah yeah, but that too, i think its better to live like that, like something from the high rises of the university specially if someone goes at night.
yeah its relaxed.
its just that, um yeah its nice too
not worry about anything.
too walk a long time, people live in baltimore, but the blocks are big, their should be
yeah, there's not light
yeah, huge um?
and no light
there's not light, no light.
on the streets
yeah. there's no light, but high-rises are better, its calmed, you don't have to buy every piece of furniture.
uhum
eh. if something happens, you just call the university,
yeah
but and, and one has that, that also there are many I have heard many stories of so of problems between people that, that share an apartment
Hi
Hi, ¿who am i speaking to?
Hi, I'm Olaya, in Philadelphia.
Olay, i am Arturo.
¿Are you spanish?
Uh, no, I'm from Mexico.

Right.
¿And you?
I'm in the linguistics program.
Oh, okay. I mean, ¿do you have anything to do with this program?
no,
ah, okay
but, no
and pa- and p- and, with what end are you'll doing this program, or what is it for
well the LDC what it does is collect all type of lagnostic data, can be test like it test-eh oeal thing then this may be used for many things like for example
a-
ah,programs that can understand voice need-they need a training, do not need
ah, okay. ah
a sample should we say.
okay, okay,
and then maybe mm. for example for that you can do and and for studies from how people pronounce the letters to the dialoge how it develops do not know how don't know
yea, wow.
for many things, And the LDC they do they do that,collect data in many languages and then people,
yeah,
you can use for practical things or more theoretical studies No?
More especialized.
mhm, yes, yes
Wow,okay,hear and this one Where do you live here in Philadelphia what neighborhood.o?
Well I live in west Philly. but well good not many.West lets say I live off forty three and Spruce.
Ah okay.Ah well yes is, is, no,no too west.how you say.
No, to much west
Yes, I live at the campus
I see
But I live all the way up, in the 40th
Mm
in the high rises
Mm
And, how does things work there, living in the 43th?
Well, I really like them, I mean, before living here
yes?
they told me that Philadelphia was dangerous and
yes
take care of West Philly, even in some guides, it's written that being at the campus at night is dangerous
really?
And well, this is my second year here and
Mmm
And well, I haven't saw anything, I have never felt insecure in general, I mean it might be because
I don't look around, i don't check the local news, I feel a little frighten
Yes, also that
And I don't know, Nothing has happen to me, and i don't feel threaten, i don't think this is a dangerous place. But I know people who are really scared of West Philly and
Yes.  People, black people, no? like there are many people who are intimidated by black people here.
yes, but, well, mm
E- to me
that is their- that is their problem. No? I mean, I don't know.
yes, of course.  No, but it is that, I mean, like, many people associa- West Philly with like, well, the barrio like the ghetto, no? like l- l-
Mmh, mmh
black neighborhoods, and like, unsafe
yes, mmh, mmh, yes, that-
But,
N- I mean, tell me, tell me.
I mean, I, I don't feel like so intimidated either or anything because I have a friend who lives around forty-fifth,
Mmh
and, and I walk there very frequently.  And, and at night aso, and everything,
Mmh, mmh.
and e- and I run into a lot of people too, there, sometimes, at night, because I have to cross through, through, this, through the park,
yes.
and, this, and there are many people, there are also, this, at night, there, that at two in the morning are there partying, and, well, this,
I have never been threatened, or, I mean, they never ask me a cigarette or something like that, and already.
Mmh, mmh, mmh.
No, I mean, in, in truth no- I don't see that they are provoking, there, like
no, is it true that things happen, i know, a girl that got in trouble, right?
ah okay.
and, but those kind of things happen in every city.
yeah, everyone yeah,yeah,yeah
and there are crimes in every city, i don't know i think there is here.
yeah ha
We think about it too much, and people keep doing it, and it goes on tv, the newspaper, so then the end they create a collective state.
yeah,yeah
From psychosis, right?
Yeah, I think its like you said, like its exaggerated, so, people do it by themselves
Yeah
Like him, the idea that its very insecure, but it actually isn't, its not that insecure, its just the ideas you make in your head.
mhm, Mhm
Its getting worse then before actually.
Mhm and west philly, doesn't have good zones, but it does at the same time, its good for traveling.
yeah.yeah
And i don't know, there's people that live in the center, that would think nothing happens, right?
What no
And, and i know, i think its a nice neighborhood actually. to be honest
yeah. its all the same thing for me.
Mhm.
What this means this is not very nice, or anything similar to it, but it is as you said you have nice places to take a walk.
Well I am living as a university student. I don´t want to be far away from here. I want to be in touch with the people and the University.
Yes, Yes, Yes, Mm.
I also believe that.
Yes.
That's the reason why it is very comfortable for the ones that live in the university.
Mm. One time  I took A walk to 70th st. or something like that. I started to walk and I left.
really?
I wanted to see what I would there. And,
and what did you find?
Well I found a normal neighborhood. A poor neighborhood. The neighborhood look ugly and the houses looked old.
Ok.
saw poverty in some places.
Yes
I But. I didn't see anything wrong, I didn´t feel scared.
Yes. You didn´t?
Well, I feel that the profit of that neighborhood was worst than others.
They do not make much money. Yes.
And of course, It also surprised me that I didn´t see one bank on the street.
yes, yes, yes
are the things that have surprised me the most about Philadelphia. no? The, the big division that there still exist.
yes, is that the displacement is incredible.
yes, Mm.
yes is incredible to see that, the more you go to the west, there are more black people, and there's less whites.
Mm. mm. yes, really, and sometimes, is interesting, I, mm , I take the bus here, here in front of my house, and sometimes, when I get on the bus, everyone is black, and the bus like starts changing color no? as it moves,
yes, yes, yes
that you go east, and when you go west, the other way around, is one thing
yes, yes, yes. Is true, I've ridden the bus just one time. But, I do remember, also, getting on it. And, then, then I noticed that
everyone was black when I was going towards the west.
yes, yes, yes. Is interesting.
yes, but, that's also a result of, that the majority of the the, the black people here, are of lower income. Therefore,
Of course, Of course. Is more related to the social class. No? more than a racial thing, is clear, yes.
Of course, yes, more than anything. Is simply just that. But,
What part of Mexico are you from?
from the city. Mexico City.
They say is dangerous. No? Or, that is
yes, yes, yes, there is much more serious, that matter. Not as much as here, that, that here is really serious.
mm
and specially, there's still a lot of separation, between the social classes. And, is very obvious, is,
Yeah. Mhm. B-
I am from a, I have like a, an appearance much more, eh, European, let's say. I am, I am blond, I have white skin and light eyes,
Mhm, mhm. Mhm.
if I go walking through a neighborhood, over there in Mexico, a bit unsafe,
Mhm, mhm.
you better believe it that I'm not getting out of there with my wallet
Wow.
nor, I mean, but I, I, of an hour. I mean, no, they will take no time in catching me.
Aha, aha, aha,
And they may even kidnap me. I mean, it's much more likely that they would kidnap me.
I had heard that too. I mean, kidnappings like that
yes, it's impressive. Right now, it's it's interesting, because kidnappings, who who they kidnap. I mean, it's not because you belong to a certain family
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
prominent, nothing, whomever, they get you into a car, they take you away, and they call it express kidnapping. Then they, they, take you away, and they get what they can from you. I mean, form a few,
Wow.
thousands of dollars, up to, if you have much more, well, whatever you have. But, what you have. I mean, not more, people are
Mhm.
like very desperate. Then, well, they do stupid things, really. And it's
Mhm, mhm.
it's terrible. But, well, this, but, well, to tell you the truth, I mean, lately, also there have been much more social conscience about what, th- the th- citizens, this, now they're really starting, let's say to oppose it, you get me? Then,
people report the, uhm, the muggings, people are now opposing to them
hmmm
I mean, there's been a lot, uhmm, a lot more participation. Because, before, it was like, no one
And people didn't do it before, no, no, they didn't report it because they were afraid
yes, because, yes, no? And, because, really, the security system was practically useless. I mean, you reported a crime and
hmm
it was just a paperwork procedure that, that didn't go anywhere
yes, yes, yes. Hmm
But, then, lately, they've been, let's say, reaffirming the action of the Police, and things like that. And trying to
hmm, hmm
to catch more thieves, and kidnappers. And a lot more, so that way. Then, people feel there's a little more response to, to all those
hmm, hmm
to those reports
hmm
Before, not so much. But even then, and also, for example, there was a march in Mexico, a couple years ago
Hmm
almost a year and a half ago, and it was called, hmm, A Silent March for Mexico's Security, and everybody went to walk to the
to the city's main square
hmm
And millions of people went to the march, it was packed
Wow Mhm mhm.
Or is they would see all the world dressed in white, and the wold world on the streets.
Wow,impresive.
then ah like you noticed that yes osea is is is the truth something socially needed. osea the people are there
Mhm,mhm
a lot more attention to secureity.
Mhm,mhm and,no,
any other thing.
Do not know how it is Me-forgive I say also I do not know how it is in Mexico, but also I believe that here television comes in osea,
provokes No? That there, the same scares because the news are more local and very
yes
going around every issue going around and they explain and explain again and
yes.yes,yes,yes.
really.
yes very yelloish,we say No?
yes,yes,yes,yes they look for mordibity and I do not know what
but,yes.yes.
And.
well yeah in Mexico in Mexico that is not as much not as much because it is it is osea so excesive that,that lle-what
already.
it's practically impossible to keep on showing every hold up or every
Mhm, mhm, mhm.
each, well, violation, or each, I don't know,
Mhm.
each robbery. You get me? So, it's only the ones that are exorbitantly large. I mean, when they are kidnappings
Sure.
very drastic, or when they are, like the, the, the, the, the case of the, the dead women in Juarez, that are, that are
Alex, ah, Besy.
Aha, it's Javier.
Oh, Hi
Hi, how are you? eh, like. Eh, I think that this is good, I have never taken part in, like a jury but but I would like some day, I don't know about you
Ah, no, they sent me a letter last year
ah, yes?
but, for, already, for serving as a jury I said that I, ah, that I rather not
Ah, No, eh, you know that sometimes they say that, it's a bit difficult because, more than anything else compromising
Mhm.
because, maybe afterwards you have, if there's some trouble, I don't know, like there is your, I think, that they have, they have like your record, or your data in court, it's safer, I don't know
I don't know, I say that serve as a jury is something, ah, dangerous because well, it depends on the case that you will serve as a jury in
or that one if it's a, a
Aha
a case of someone that killed someone, or, or if someone from the, ah of the a, that sells drugs from the
yes, yes
What do you call it? from the
A, well, a drug dealer, or something
Aha. And, th- they may have friends, bah, let's say you say, OK, he's guilty and then he could have friends and say ah this one, go after this person and kill her children or her
Oh, I see, I see, you're right, no, because he can say she is like that and
aha I see
and I could do a description of you and
Mhm.
and it can, yes it could happen too, but I don't know, but they say that, that, I mean it is optional if you, if they sent you a letter
aha
eh, is it optional if you want or have to go?, I don't know exactly.
No, well the letter that was sent to me, um, I said no, but I sent a letter from my doctor
Aha
saying that I couldn't be seated for a long period of time. Because, because I have an illness that I can't be seated for a long time, or walk for a long time, or stand for a long time.
Oh
so they said it was ok, that I did not have to serve as jury
Sure, it is
And that was last year
Oh yes, it's like a , a friend also received a letter like that, but he works, from six in the morning to four in the afternoon, then he didn't, he said that he
eh, the company manager said that he was someone who couldn't, couldn't be absent
it was, OK and I guess he asked for a letter
Exactly
to send to the jury, to, so he
Well, yes, yes. But I don't know, I mean, sometimes I think it would be good because, most specially in cases of
girls and boys rapes
Mhm
If you can serve as a juryand, and, and if, what's like? if you realize that the person, I mean the person is guilty and
you can help to make justice faster, I think is a good idea
OK, for that yes but, but good, I would like it at all
Ah
because I'm not, I'm not a yeller and, OK
today, yeller
no, if something happens, ah, rape of kids and the, I don't know, the show a video of something, eh
Oh, Ok, Ok, no, I would not resist, not because it's ugly, or horrible that
Oh, no, it's ugly, yes
you, ah, where did they send you, I mean, what state?
Ah, no, I live in Canada
Oh, you are living in Canada, oh
yes, aha, and you?
I'm here in New York
Oh, aha
yes, but, but what I was telling you is about my friend in Arizona, because I was living in Arizona and
Aha, Um, oh
and then, but there in CAnada, eh, the system is the same, eh, you thin-
More or less, I think, I don't know
Oh, look at you, um, oh, it's good, it's good, then
already
You never know when you would come, but as you said we need to be careful, right?
Already. We need to be careful. It depends, but no one tells you what to do. Maybe only the judge knows.
Unclear
or where does it have to be
I imagine that they do a meeting, or a session to explain the case
but that is when you told you were going to do it.
You are already inside and you have to decide
alredy, be the jury
oh, already
And if you said no, I don't want to do it. It´s too late.
No, too late
He already said yes.
What was your real name?
Besy. Besy, Already.
Petty Oh, Sessy or Jessy?
No, Besy, with a B
Oh Besy, Oh.
Already, Ok. Ansd yours, Javier?
Javier, Yes, Yes, Yes.
Yes, mine is difficult.
Oh? you who are living in Canada, then how much time ?
Fifteen years already.
Fifteen years ? Wow
Yea, yea.
How can you resist the cold ?
Ah, well, I lived in a city before where the winter was very cold and had enough snow.
Yea
Enough snow fell
Yes
and then, my husband and y decided to move, to the beach.
Yes
in o-, in another province
Oh.
and then here, the winter here is just like the rain, nothing more
Oh
and it does not get cold
Oh, yea, in what state is that ? Province or state ?
Aha. It is a province, the British Columbia, it is close to where I live in Vancouver, if you have not gone to the city.
Oh, Vancounver. It is not from Washington State ?
Ok, ok, more or less, ok, yes, OK
Ok, Oh yes. And you know l was planning traveling to Vancuver, because some friends from Bolivia were there
Ok, yes
but I lost their track and I could't get there, because they told me that life over there is really quiet, i do not know if that's true
Oh, OK. I spoke to someone before and he told me that you should be living in a paradise and I asked him: why you say dad?
because there are many islands everywhere and the sea is really close and you could go to the United States
Oh
Well, having a passport
Ok, yes, yes
he can go alone, cross the border
Ah
10 minutes from here to the border
Ok, i see
Yes, from Washington
Oh, and,, where are you from originally?
From El Salvador
Oh, i thought that, I am from Ecuador
Ok, yes
yes, because i can hear a little bit of Salvadorian accent, that's nice, and well, l want to go there someday
Ok, yes
like the justice topic, sometimes here the things are not very well.
OK
and the, the, how?
Oh, sorry
yes, tell me
No, mmm, well, how do you call it?, One who kill somebody and will receive the death penalty.
yes
Is it happening in some State there?
Here in the United States?
the death penalty, OK
Sure, they put you in the gas chamber, you know
Ok, but i was watching the news the other day about a woman who killed her three children.
OK
She put them in the water and drowned them.
Oh yea, yes, yes, yes
then my mother told me, they should kill her, and i said it is better to put her in jail, that way she is going to suffer more
if the other prisoners know what she did
OK
i say, they will shatter her in pieces, i say
Sure, she is going to have a very hard time, you can imagine, ok, a serial killer who killed someone
and right away, what? to the gas chamber? No, well they have to punish them, yes or no? of some years
yeah, sure, something to make them suffer, because if they only kill them and
Yeah, right, That's it
he suffered, mm, what, ten minutes or whatever, and he was but, but if they get him in jail, ah the other inmates, mm
Mhm.
poor guy
yes, but no
That's it, people really suffer there, I say.
Sure, it's, they'll get him there
Mhm, there you go, he's going to pay for what he did, yeah.
What he did. I don't know why, why ah, why do people do that, no?
Yeah.
Yeah, but well, as I tell you not even
Who knows? Crazy people.
people are crazy
Mhm.
and as I tell you here it's, it's getting difficult every time you hear comments that, that in Canada things are quieter
Yeah, here it's a bit quieter, yes
yes.
because I imagine that the health care of, of the United States is not, is so good, or, or is like the, the, the, eh, how do you call it?
What do you call that, that, mm a card, the card that you are given for health.  I do not know what you call it.
Oh, the, I don't know, Medicare, something like that.
yeah, Me- Medicare, yeah, that one
Yeah,
Is not, not that good.
Yeah, exactly.
Oh really?
And over there?
Umh, here is mm I say that is good, because
Is much more fair, then,
Is much more fair, since here is more fair than the
How great.
then there
Listen, and and how is working opportunities there?
yeah, well they are looking for many people to work in construction
What type, any kind? Um, construction,
I am sure, um, I think is to make building, something like that
yeah,
yeah, and they request from other towns
oh
Well, if one has it, if one has experience of making buildings, or making houses, things like that
yes yes
I imagine that you could ask for a visa or something i don't know
oh no why
ha
because i heard that you can. that, this country Canada needs a lot of people right?
at least in the state where I'm at, um i heard news yesterday that they were, they needed people for
for, construction work
oh yeah, well, there's a program, on the internet that if one get points, like sixty four points, and one,
can go work and the government will help them with everything
where? here?
yes
oh, really? i didn't know that
yes that's right
mm
yes, that means you can
mhm
Im interested in doing that, right?
yeah
it would be good
I see.
And have you had a problem with the going to court or that?
Me?  No.
yes
Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?
Hello? I'm sorry
Hello? Yes, no, it's okay, uh. What's your name, where are you from?
John, from New York
Ok, my name is Jennifer, from New York.
And you? Oh
Ok, so, let's begin so that we can finish quickly.
Yes, what was the topic? Did you hear it?
Ok, so, uh, the subject was, uh, uh, interracial marriages.
Oh ok, cause I didn't hear it, mine.
Oh, yeah, that's it, that's today's subject, so, what do you think about interracial marriages?
To me, it doesn't bother me. After all, you just fall in love with a person.
Hm mm
yes, you can marry whoever you want.
I see, well I
No, to me, I don't think I worry about it. Nobody should worry about that.
Yes I, I was also asked that, what do we think of uh, if it is easier for certain races to marry, for example, for white or Chinese people.
I don't
Uh, blacks and Hispanics, they want to know that.
I think it's not easier, but it's more like, no, not better, because as a Latin person to marry another Latin person, not, yes, right now it depends on where you live, where you live, if you get married, if I'm Latin and I marry a brunette or something,
Hm mm
in many places, maybe many people will criticize.
Oy, yes, cri- they always criticize. They criticize if, if you marry
We are, yes
yes, if you are je- and you marry a Hispanic, cla-
yes, but all the races, what race are you?
I, I am uh, my father is Dominican.
aha, and your mother?
I and eh, both parents.
Both parents are dominican, well, I am Puerto Rican.
Yes ah, well yes, my, my husband is Puerto Rican.
Yes
So ah, that was also a problem.
With his.
With his family sure, his doesn't like Dominican people much.
Yes
So nevertheless, when one looks around, that doesn't have anything to do with race, because even my husband says it. If we went into the detail
things of a family, if it was a family situation,
Yes
my family, there are more professionals in my family, we are more educated, uh,
Yes
unfortunately, in ergonomic stuff we are more stable, economically. However
Yes, i...
The only reason they had for not liking me, was that the last girlfriend he had before me was Puerto Rican.
And i am from Dominican parents, born here, raised here.
Right, no, i am, i uh, i have Dominican family.
Right.
I have a lot of cousins that married Dominican ladies.
G..
And, uh, they, they have left them.
Right.
Divorced and everything, and they don't keep in touch, and still when the girls see them every time, we're like, "that's my cousin", and they have, they have lived with us and everything.
Right.
And they have always been raised as, uh, they're my family, we comply, i have a lot of Dominican friends.
Yeah, uh, i can't understand the ignorance of...
I have black relatives too. My cousins have married african-american males, uh
Yeah, i have, a, my brother's wife is, uh, african-american, she's, you know...
Yeah, wh-, ¿where in New York are you?
¿Come again?
¿Where in New York?
Uh, uh, Manhattan
Oh, I am in the Bronx
Oh, OK So yeah, so um the topic for me uh, I don't understand it, hav- having been uh, raised here. In, in New York. Um
Yeah, that's why I think also, I think
I understand it and for me there is no such great thing. Always when two people are happy,
Yeah,
uh, no, I care little that they're green and yellow, uh pst
Yeah, I, me too, I have gone out with gu- go- girls of different ethnicities.
Hm mm
They're, um, I don't know, I don't, I don't care. The first girlfriend of mine was dominican.
Oh OK Uh ok And, and, the funny thing is that we're not all the same.
Yes
Because there are Dominican persons in my own family, that I don't like
Yea Yea, same as, same as me, I have some friends that they are dominicans,
I, don't like
but n- they say that they're dominicans, but they don't tell many people that they're dominicans, because they treat them badly.
Yea
Because that that they're gay and all that, and he says, I have, and they don't have, because it, the same family of theirs say that they're gays.
Hm mm
like, like they tell him that they're , rude, all of those things, and they're
Yes, hm mm
they are, um nasty
Yes but
They are ashamed of themselves, I said, this has got to make them feel ashamed because this happens to all races.
But, eh, exactly. To deny, I mean, I love to talk to people about my professional life, I talk to all types of persons. What I means is that
I'm talking to you, where are you from? I'm Dominican.
Yeah, I know a guy, ok.
What? From where? How is that possible, I was thinking that you were, what does it have to do with anything
No, I know a guy, he's a cop, a real cop.
Hm mm
And I, he always, he has tattoos, um of the Puerto Rico flag.
Aha
And so I thought he was from Puerto Rico, but two or three weeks ago, we did had a barbeque, no, more than three weeks ago, to say goodbye to the summer
Aha
And he was there, his wife was talking and something happened and he said bag words to the flag. I don't do that, and he told me that he was swearing to the flag because he is not Dominican, he's this and he did
Eh
his, like how, when he became a citizen here
Hm mm
and he said he was from Puerto Rico but that he had changed his documents so that he could be from Puerto Rico
But, that's
Well that he was born here, but he changed absolutely everything that his parents and everything, all of that.
He is your friend, but that is ignorance, because
Yeah, I said, but and why did you do it, then he said, because those people have not ta, don't talk to me.  He does not
you know
does not want to know about anything Dominican, I say, but I, that is not like that because right now, there are Puerto Ricans that don't want to have anything to do with Puerto Ricans, but
Yes
for life they say, oh, I am Puerto RIcan.
Is that, no
Never sa- they never change.  I don't know why you should change it.
Exactly
And he well no, I am I am American, Puerto Rican American, and  with that you don't do that
That is doesn't have, that is, I'm sorry but that is ignorance.
Oh me, being Dominican, hey I am Dominican, because that I can not change
Yeah, that is ehm
Not like him, that has been paying and paying, to change absolutely everything, to get that he is a PuertoRi- and Do, and, and from New, New York
And you still, still been know that it doesn't have anything to do with that.
Hm mm
That's it, that does not change anything because still
Yeah Where, where, where I am working now,
Aha
en the Bronx here, there are many Dominicans.  There are, are, there are many boricuas. But there are Dominicans too.
Hm mm
How many people talk, ho, Dominicans are stupid, they don't know how to do anything, there's a lot, there's a lot of Dominicans.
There are from all kinds, in all of the, the races.
Ehm, you say, there are more Dominicans than Whites.
Yes, no yes because that is true with Dominicans, that they like to multiply
Ye
to have children
Yeah, no, and then the, the, the Puerto Ricans do not say anything.  Because the more, like they say, the more Hispanics, more Latinos, the better
Yeah
The whities are the ones that there are too many Dominicans, and this, and this  and this.
Yeah
Thes Puerto Ricans want to get oh, absolutely everything here
Ehm, but, you know, that
Like that
Ehm Yeah, I feel like speaking English, uhm I can't, we can't
I know so, I am getting up I as well
But all- that is because the brother, is a police officer here, in Manhattan
Yeah, yeah
In the twenty-three And, I see, house Uhm, and he, uhm and I work with uhm, in inves- Uhm, like an investigator, but I work mainly with police officers.
Yes
So, in that
Yes
So, a moment, yeah so that's what I always say, Always, oh, where are you from? after talking with me for a while, I've helped it, they've said things uh, of dominicans, in front of me,
They've said, oh yeah, yes, so blah blah blah blah, they say, "Oh, where are you from?" uh, Dominican
Yeah, I've uh, I, I talk about Dominicans like that too
Eh, oh
But in front of them, and also of Puerto Ricans in front of them
Yes, right?
Talking, is something, talking, but some of them talk about them and they fall deep until, u- until they get the point
Oh yeah, no
Because I, I sometimes, we're, we're a group talking and I say, look it's Dominican, how dirty, that and that, but I'm on a group, with
Ahá ahá
two or three dominicans, two or three Puerto ricans,
Aha,
With whiteys, that's, that's how we chat
Yeah because
But
You can, but the, the diference is that you can critique. A person and, and describe like that Dominican stopped there on the corner
Yeah, because when I see people on the street, that I know, that I see they're dominicans, they have a flag or something, they're Dominicans
Ok, but Yea
i, hey Dominican, come here
Yeah, exactly, aha
Like that
They know each other because, pitifully, the worst Dominicans, that do all that stuff they are marked, they have a tattoo
Yes like the
they have a shirt, are
Yes like the women too,
Yes
You can see them from far for something
Oh yeah eh, yeah, yeah that too, but we aren't all like that. Is, that is, the funny thing, because when i was at the university that was like, where are you from ?
New York, oh oh, what, what, how, what what ethnicity are  you, oh, I'm Dominican, Oh no.
Si yeah
I don't think so
Yeah Yeah, turn around
Yeah Oh, no, that one, that one is unfortunately that's a, a trait we all have but, but still, it's the whole point of
Excuse me the point that, um, because we are and have that attribute
Yeah
No, doesn't want to say that we are all equal
Yeah
Because I have cousins that I'm embarrassed of, because they are sluts, basically
Yeah oh no no, I didn't mean it that way, I meant it with the back part
And, no no. But no no, I understand But you know, let's you go, to the heart of it.
yeah
Eh, they are like that, and I also have people
Yeah
your know, we are professionals we do what we do, and unfortunately ok, so my grandmother had a nice behind, and everybody inherited it
Well yeah, but you know, it's like that always, it's like
But
that, that they are you know like like, sluts, like you said.
No
Puerto Ricans.
Eh we all have one
Dominicans, hell yeah.
yeah, so it's like, but, it bothers me that something as simple as you know you are Puerto Rican, I'm Dominican,
Like, look at me, my family, with their own cousins, and everything.
No no no. I know, but
I know that for a fact
Yeah, but what kills me is that we're so close in proximity.
Yeah
Dominicans, Republicans, Santo Domingo are what, like ninety miles apart? We're closer than Florida and Cuba
Yeah
And we hate each other just because of where we were born, what is that?
Yeah It's not even, it's because like some, like the Dominicans say, oh Dominicans think they're better than us, and Puerto Ricans thing they're better than us, like that
Exacty, yeah, but I, you know
And that's all starts, like even in chatrooms, in the computers checking out the chatrooms,
Hm mm
and that's just like crazy, the way that we're fighting
It just, it makes me laugh, I usually don't tell people until I'm asked, but I never deny my race.  Like people say something, and I"ll stand and be like, oh, hold up.
Yeah well, the reason why I part asked you why you're from New York, 'cause
Hm mm
like what part of New York, 'cause you sound like like White
Get out of here
Yeah, you sound like White
Oh, thank you so much, I speak Spanish like a white person too?
But no, nothing of course, not now, let the Spanish come out
Oh, L - let me find out, ok, that's another, eh ,that's another thing that bothers me. Just because a person is, um, You what, what does it mean to some white
Yea, like
You know what I'm saying, what
Like me, when I told you I'm from the Bronx, I thought you were going to hang up, because I had three callers, I told them I'm from the Bronx, and they hang up
Hm mm
they hang up on me
No, abs, please, I'll tell everybody I don't care
In, in Florida DisneyWorld
hmm mm
It was a line, and we were standing a few excuse me, 'cause you had, the line was moving, but they weren't moving
Yeah
And i had, I said Bronx new York, and they Oh, honey, come on, they're from the Bronx, and they moved, and they got off the line like
out embarrassed,
No, it's no, it's not your fault, it's not
I was like, oh, oh well
your fault is not to, is you know, people act ignorant around me all the time, and say stupid things like that, and it's like
yea
Hello?
yes, hello?
Hello, good night.
Good night, how are you?
Fine, who am I talking to?
David.
Ah, David, this is Joe, Jo, Jose
yes, how are you?
Ah, fine, fine. Where do you live?
Here in Connecticut, I think I talk to you about a week ago
Ah, yes, yes, yes, how are you?
yes, the call was dropped, right?
yes, I don't know why.
Ah, I don't know why.
Ah, yes, I don't know what they are going to do with that, because  they have
So, how have you been?
so many  calls that, that, have dropped. And a couple, yes, I think
yes.
there are lots of people that, I don't know, that, that, they have so many calls that they haven't processed yet. So, I think they don't know how many calls
each person has. So, I don't know what they are going to do. There are lots of people now, my mo, she has reached twenty five calls.
Uhm, yes?
But, she knows there were several calls that didn't drop.Then she doesn't know what to do, right?
Oh, but they still call you, or not?
Yes,They still call her. I don't Know, two weeks ago, yesterday they called her, I think they still call her, but I don't know.
Oh, and they only pay her for twenty five, right?
I think yes, I think yes, but, hum, at the end I think they are not very organized, and that surprises me because
it's something they already done that, the,the LDC, they done that 2 years ago or one and a half years ago.
yes, do it in English. right?
But, that was before, that was in English, but they did it in Arabic, and, and Spanish and whatever. But that is an old story, they have done it several times, then, I do not know, at least once
uhm
and then were several months, so I do not know why suddenly is something new
oh, yea, uhm, sincerely, I don't know,or...
No
It is clear, because last time, uhm,yes, uhm, The topic was religion
were like 15 or 20 days of the same topic only.
I Know,no,no, and it was not only the recorder I think they had some kind of computer or something else
uh uhm
And what I said it was my theory, but they write a text in English with the things they want you to say
what you hear. right?
uhm
Then, they went to the auto-this, translator, then, they pur there the text
aha
from English to Spanish, and then, there, from, from there, they copied to a computer, that, that that did, I don't know, that, then, there are computers, or programs that one
put, put a text, and then the computer, the computer reads it
Right,
yes, yes, No, no, well, well, the translator, it was something like that, a kind, I imagine
aha
Then, the thing that was speaking
Ah
I imagine that was it, it was a computer
Sure, sure, sure, Mhm
Then, no, no, not only had a very bad accent, but everything it was saying was, for examle, when the calls ended, it said
your time if for above
Yeah, no, never I saw more, because when
yes, no, no, no, I don't.  Me neither, well, I, I, I did not even look until, until many times, really? what I heard, what, what, what I don't understand anything, right?
yes
And, then, once, there, I heard, ah, yes, your time is for above. Or, for example, once, co/ Was was that? they had, am, the, the topic was dating
then,
Mhm
the, the translation in Spanish was to put in the calendar, Then like that, Do you like to put in the calendar? Things like that, that are
Yeah
Ay.  Incredible.  But, and, and, they obviously have people who speak Spanish, right? Ay, I don't know.  Like that I, no
Yeah but it depends
it has not been good, very, very, very well organized.
No, because they are always tiring the systems, because if you you send an e-mail, they answer you well, back, the next day, very fast.
Mmh.  Mm, yes.  Shudong, yes.  But, the good thing is that they pay well, in the end.  One is a little bit- sometimes it is a little annoying, like that, to have to answer and,
but, no, it is not so bad, there.  And, they pay well.
Yeah, but ah, with, with me, I, I, the other time I did it and it ended.
Mmh.
And, and I don't know what happened, that they didn't call me back, and they didn't have a phone to call or something like that, but they sent me a check.
Mmh.
You know, like sixty days went by, maybe like two months went by, and they sent me a check.
Mm. Mmh.
I even forgot.  I didn't, I didn't even know.,
Ah, a surprise
Yeah, that's, that's true And you live in Philadelphia, No?
yes, in Philadelphia, yes, yes well, well my mom lives outside, I live here, eh, in West Philly, in
OK
At the university.  Then,
Oh, because you live outside too, no?
I'm here, I'm here MM?
in the school? You guys go to Penn State you told me. No?
No, no. University of Pennsylvania yes, no, no, yes is different, yes, everyone gets confused with that, because there is, well Penn State
is in the middle of the state,
Yeah Aha.
and is, is a public university.
Right
And so, the university where I'm at, is University of Pennsylvania.
Ah, in two different, then.
yes, exactly, yes, that's private, and is in the city, is completely different. The other one is, is much bigger, is public is in the country.
Yeah those that are in , another thing. No?
Ah.
Where the mountains are, No?
I don't know. since, I've never gone there, I, I don't know, exactly, where it is.
Over there Oh.
But, I do know is in the middle. Perhaps in the eighty one, perhaps one, possibly. But, but, even though the eight one, I think goes more towards
no. Possibly yes, possibly yes, because I know that the eighty one goes to I don't know, is better if I don't say anything. I
For me, is the same.
yes, all I know about the eighty one is that, because we used to live in Tennessee before,
and northeast,
Alright
and then, there around Virginia, we lived in Virginia. Then we passed to Tennessee. But, I spent eighty-one there, that is all I know. So,
Ah, okay.
It seems that it is- the road is long, I don't know. I don't know. But, yes, e- but then, you, but, You end up, you are studying, or what,or whatever you do
Ah, no, . I wish I was working, uh, I wish I was going to school
Mm. Ah, okay.
But, am,
Much easier, I imagine,
Yeah one no, no, no think, but, when one is in school, thatis where all the friendships are, you don't have to to, to, ah, you know , communicate with your friends.
No, the whole world is right there, in the very center. Youknow
yes, yes, yes, yes.
But, already when one leaves, and has to be at home, and hasto pay the, the, the expenses of the house, it is very difficult. It is better to stay in a school.
yes, it is good, for, the, the good thing about beinn in the university, is that is a place that, already when onefinishes, already one's expenses, go up
enough. Really? So, it is, and buyinng a car, and and, and you want this, you want the other. So, one already must begin to work. Really? To to maintain, as long as you are a student, one lives there
Yeah, forcibly. Yeah
in short, I don't know. I don't know, if you know of Roman Noodle Soup,
No, no, no.
no, no, no, these soups, that are sold by, by Raman, thatcost, yes, twenty-five cents.
Oh, yeah, yeah
yes, one lives on Roman Noodle Soup, twenty-five cents,the twenty-five cent meal, one, then, it is so,
Yeah, yeah yeah
you spend a lot less, but its a life more, quiet, yeah, is quiet, but also i think that, when the people remember when they were students, they forget everything, all the work they had passed, its not true?
Of course, yeah
Yes, yes. but it's also a life with more freedom, more flexibility in the time, like for example, tonight i want to hangout
all the nights i wake up, and then, i don't know, studying, i don't care, cause i don't have class tomorrow. true?, because i don't have or have class, but, if one day i don't want to go, i don't go. true?
Eh, Yeah
But, in the work, you can't say, ahh yes, i don't want go to work today
Yeah, well, that's not happens
Only if, no, no, it's not like that, like very flexible.
No. no, , Your habilities
Mmm
In the life, When you finish school, the world calms down, you know, they get families, or get married, you know
You know, they get childs anywhere, and the life gets easier, not?
a lot harder
yeah, that's why, if you want to live the Americans live, you know, The American dream
The American dream, you know, buy her own house, etc
yes, yes, yes. The problem is that i feel that you have to be happy with the things you have, and that's the thing
the people don't do, cause your incomes gets higher obviously, and with the work, you get more responsabilities. true?
but at the same time
right
all that we consume,is one one get better car and one maybe and do another and that is it and when we come and see we had spend all the money right? and we just say it appears to me with all the responsabilitys right?
YEAH
then don't know don't know I am happy like a student for now. right? but eventually one must save buy a house but,
don't know that scares me, to have many set bills right? because we only work and work ,work
yeah
and we feel that we are not enjoying the money, right? but also in part we say well we do not think about the benefits right? but also
one has a car to go to work, right? then we have that need to have then you need to cut the herbs don't know i believe is too much,
right yeah
too much, like set bills is responsibility set that is
yeah you are more more responsibility in life
yes definitely
but, you know but and then the poor people life, is more more easy.
yes,no
the life of poor has nothing to do,you know if you want to work you work if you don't want to work they support you
yes,yes is that.
you know
it contains the wife
yeah more or less same thing,you now
yes
that is why you need a good woman one that can help you that she has house an apartment that helps you for this or that
yes, yes.
no, but that's life, yeah, no? you know
yes.
Live and learn
yes, no, yeah, n- eh, I think that, that there are, there are, that's why, that, that one has to have, like that, I think, care with, with
how you spend money. Because, it's easy. Because, for example, if, if one buys something, then buys another, and buys another, I, you have nothing and one feels that one doesn't, won't enjoy the money, right?
One has to seriously look into
Right
what is more important, right? what, what what is it that you like to do
right No, but e-
And if not, it's not that. Then, better not to spend money on that. Right?
You tell me, the, the big companies, are g- are giving you things
That's what I think.
Don't you see that the, the, r- big companies give, give you cars, no money down? they give you the, the things,
